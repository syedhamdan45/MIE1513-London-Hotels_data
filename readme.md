# Hotel Reviews Sentiment Analysis Project

This project involves performing analysis of real hotel review data crawled from the Tripadvisor website to automatically identify positive and negative keywords and phrases associated with hotels and to better understand characteristics of data analysis tools, extracting explanatory review summaries, and human reviewing behavior. The data in this case is chosen for London, Ontario, Canada.

Vader sentiment analyzer is used in this project to compute the sentiment for each hotel review. The importance of certain terms on the sentiment is determined by using Mutual Information. The reasons for the best and worst hotel reviews in the city are explored. The results are also visualized using various tools such as histograms, box plots and scatter plots.
