Also, they have a great indoor playground with a full-size climber, basketball net, play houses, and many, many toys!  During specific times, you can leave your child there for an hour to be supervised to make crafts, play video games, etc.. in their craft room!  We really enjoyed our visit, the kids (ages 4 and 2) had a great time!  They especially liked their welcome goodie bag filled with toys and colouring books, and we also liked that they ate free in the dining room!

This is not for lack of effort on the part of the staff - they're always hustling - but is rather a result of the tight space in front of the hotel and large groups who can swing in quickly, overrunning the front door staff. When it's not busy the service is perfect.\n\nFood service is good, as far as quality is concerned, but the pricing is a bit much. We tend to eat at one of the many nearby restaurants for better value.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent option in London. The room price is right, the location excellent, and the service outstanding. The Delta London Armouries is always our first choice of hotels in London.",5,positive

They however did not have a lightening cable for the iPhone though, but it didn't matter as like most traveller, I brought my own. \n\nThe bathroom only had a shower, so for those who like to take a bath, you should check with the hotel before booking or ask at check in. \n\nI was able to eat something at the concierge lounge when I checked in and then had breakfast there the next morning.  For evening snacks, they had a cheese plate, crackers, cold cuts, coconut battered shrimps, chicken skewers, tomato soup as well as a couple of desserts. The also served beer and wine, which you can charge to your room. Breakfast the next morning was cereal, scrambled eggs, sausage, cold cut plate, various breads, and Starbucks coffee and juice.  In terms of the food, this is one of the better concierge lounges that I've experienced. My only complaint is that bottled water, whether it was flat water or Perrier was in short supply and not replenished. But this is the case at most lounges I've been to so not really a knock on the Delta Armouries hotel. \n\nThe valet service was quick and efficient when I checked in and when it was time to depart. \n\nThe only issue I had was that the heat in the room didn't seem to work.

The people and the staff are absolutely top-notch but the property itself is lacking.\nWe were there on conference for three days beginning on a Sunday.  There were more than 170 delegates arriving from all over Canada.  The annual ritual is for everyone to meet in the bar upon arrival to get caught up and figure out what's going on.  Not this year , the Delta bar is closed on Sundays!\nWe stayed on the Executive Club floor with access to the Executive lounge.  Our room was on the 18th floor.  We turned on the air conditioning full blast when we arrived late afternoon as the room was really hot.  We kept the air on the entire time we were there and the room never got cold.  It was tolerable but never really cooled down to where we like for sleeping.  That being said, the beds are incredibly comfortable and we both slept great.\nThe bathroom looked to be original.  The water pressure was okay but what really threw me off was the stuff growing in shower grout.  Not a pretty site.   It might help if they had ventilation in the bathrooms to remove the excess moisture.  Also, the electrical outlet for the hair dryer was so loose that I had to tie the cord of the hair dryer around the extendable mirror handle and try not to move too much as the plug would fall out of the socket.\nWe had breakfast each morning in the Executive Lounge.  Days 1 and 3 were great food and great service with day 2 being mediocre at best.\nI visited the sauna and pool area daily.  While the heritage and the feel of the building has been kept, the pool area needs work.  Tiles are cracked, some missing and it comes across as dingy.  Everything is clean, it's just tired.\nDay 2 of the conference, one of the elevators went on the fritz.  Trying to get a couple hundred people up to their rooms to get ready and back down to dinner with one elevator is slow moving at best.\nThe service was fantastic and most of the staff are absolutely wonderful people.

I booked this hotel through Expedia. when I pulled up to the front of the building I was met by valet parking which took my girlfriend's car and they also offered assistance with my bags but I declined due to their was not that much baggage. I did do my reviewing of this hotel before I booked and looked at the location and it is located downtown London. there is an ambulance station just around the corner so there is a lot of sirens that go off throughout the night which is not a problem. Sometimes when I would arrive back at the hotel I would have to go up to the front desk to drop the keys off to my car. Other than that we can start on checking in. When I got in the door I was at the front desk and I checked in the front desk was very friendly and offering any assistance to us. We proceeded to the elevator which is a little bit old but the view is amazing going up to my floor. You got amazing view of downtown London when you're going up in the elevator. I checked into my room and it was beautiful it was as described on Expedia. Lots of room lots of outlets, HDMI cable for my laptop which connected into a nice flat screen TV that was wall-mounted. There was even a ice machine on both floors 11 and 14. The ice machine on 14 was the best. I have to give a shout out to the hotel staff and cleaning people for doing an awesome job on our room and also taking care of us. During my stay I did go to the pool. The second night I was there there was a hockey tournament on going and when I went to the pool there was a ton of kids screaming and yelling and constantly splashing. I wasn't trying to be a downer but I did go to the hot tub to get away from the kids because I already had a headache and it was not helping. other than that the third day I was there.

data/ca/154995/183771/5772230.html,Delta Hotels by Marriott London Armouries,"""When I booked this hotel for Labour Day night on Priceline, I wasn't sure what to expect.  The report immediately previous to this one concerned me.  Happily, I had a better experience than that reviewer.  The room assigned - 1007 - was gorgeous and huge, with *2* king size beds.  Unfortunately, that nonsmoking room had been recently occupied by a heavy smoker.  The front desk cheerfully moved us, and sent a bellman to assist us.  The next room assigned - 1415 - was smaller, having 2 queen beds and a single easy chair.  However, it was much better from our point of view, since there was no smoke smell - or any other smell, for that matter.  We found the housekeeping thorough.  The room's large entry hall, with mirror and half moon table, was a nice touch, as was the well fitted wardrobe (with light that automatically turned on when the door was opened).  We did not make use of internet access, but the connections were convenient and easy to find.  There was a power strip with extra available electrical outlets - a real rarity in most hotel rooms! The small refrigerator worked well, as did the in room coffee pot.   It seems to me that most of these are either too grungy, or too skimpily supplied to be useful.  Not only did this one work without leaking, but it was immaculately clean, and 3 set ups were provided (along with 2 types of tea, lots of sugar, and more than enough envelopes of coffee whitener to keep me happy).  The bathroom was large, and the marble tub enclosure featured a double shower curtain on ball bearing rollers, which kept the water inside the tub where it belonged.  The hotel's small indoor pool on level 2 was amazingly pristine - especially since our stay was the first night after a holiday weekend!  We did not eat at the Armouries Grille, where the main courses start at $25, but rather at a nearby restaurant on Dundas Street. When we turned in for the night, we found the thigh high, padded beds very comfortable.  Worth noting were the soft, pure cotton linens covering a hypo-allegenic duvet, and 3 pillows plus bolster provided for each bed. The room next to us was occupied, and we didn't hear a sound.  The free morning newspaper was the Globe and Mail, rather than the local London Free Press.  One hassle was parking - either $12 for valet parking, or $7 if you park yourself.  The open, flat lot is a full block south, and across busy King Street.  If you're unlucky in finding a spot, you may have to walk all the way from York Street - 2 full blocks.  Security is either non-existant or invisible.  Also, television reception was poor, and free channels available oddly limited:  not London's usual cable line-up.  Perhaps I'd be less enthused if we'd paid more than twice what we did through Priceline, but it would have been difficult to improve on our stay.\n",4,positive

When you first walk into the lobby there is an immediate smell of chlorine from the indoor pool.   There were a couple of people wandering  through the lobby with bath robes and bare feet - obviously going to or from the pool.  \n\n I reserved a room on the Signature level ( floors 18 thru 20) which includes access to a private lounge.  This was a nice feature and provided an afternoon cocktail service and morning breakfast  ( buffet) service.   the first week that  I stayed my room was a few doors down from the elevator and the noise of the elevator cars going up and down made it very difficult to sleep.   Fortunately, I always travel with ear plugs which were necessary to block out the noise.   The following week I requested a room far from the elevators.   When I entered the room there was slight aroma of cigarette smoke but somewhat mufffled by room deodorizer.  However the first night,  all I could smell on the bed linens was cigarette smoke.   the next day,  it seemed to subside a bit but when I returned home and emptied my luggage,  there was a very noticeable smell of cigarette smoke on my clothing.     \n\nThere were a few evenings when our group was working late and therefore chose to dine in the hotel.  The food was quite disappointing.   Two of us ordered the pasta bolognese which consisted of bland noodles with a scarce amount of sauce that tasted mostly of tomato with very little meat.  the cesear salads were nondescript and    consisted of commercial brand dressing.  \n\nThe hotel offers valet service and the gentlemen who greet you when you pull up are all very welcoming and helpful.

Very nice hotel, but the best part was the stuff available for our group.

So the kids had a place to gather that wasn't someone's room, and since the entire 4th floor was dedicated to these party rooms, you didn't have to worry too much about the noise. Also in the basement, they have a small play area for kids where there are basketball nets and hockey nets. They loved playing with their mini-sticks here.\n\nThe only negative aspects were that the doors (latches) were loud, and as people went in and out of their rooms throughout the night, even though we couldn't hear people making noise, the doors were all quite loud. Also, there is no on-site parking which is a bit of a pain. The municipal lot is a block and a half away and it's $12 per night, but reception told me that sometimes it's free, depending on how busy the hotel is. Maybe it's a bonus they offer when they're trying to get more people to come? Also, the elevators were slow. We often took the stairs up and down several flights, and when we first arrived, there was such a back-log of people waiting for an elevator, that one of the staff took us around to the \""staff\"" elevator. We appreciated this, for sure, and maybe the lengthy elevator waits were just because there were so many teams staying there.\n\nOverall, a really nice hotel with lots to offer families or large groups with kids.",4,positive

The staff are friendly and attentive in all of my interactions from food servers to front desk staff.  The common areas are unique due to the original use of the building.  Other than the common areas the hotel has seen better days.  I was in room 1711 and the room is showing wear and tear.  The furniture was had scuffed and worn.  There was a hole that had been filled in above one of the beds.  I am guessing a picture was previously above the bed and the hole was poorly repaired but it could also have been the result of a customer?  Either way it didn't look very nice and could use some attention.  The bathroom had dark mold starting to show in some areas around the tub.  Upon first look at the sink I thought it was dirty and then on 2nd look noticed that it was actually pitted with spots that make it look dirty.  The ironing board has an extremely cheap pad on it and this caused my shirt to actually pick up the wafer pattern of the ironing board itself.  In fairness to the staff I noticed this issue with the ironing board at another Delta as well in Toronto a couple of weeks prior as well.  The TV was a nice flat screen and the room also included a mini fridge which is always appreciated.  I also enjoy the fact that the wifi is of decent speed and is free (unlike some hotels).

Old part of the building was stunning with medieval architecture - unfortunately no tours were offered, staff had no knowledge of the history of the place, and there wasn't even a pamphlet about the building - such a waste as I'm certain there must be some terrific stories there.  Parking was a pricey $20.  Not knowing London, we thought the hotel was in the city close to shops, but it was in the middle of nowhere.  We ventured out to the local corner store to find a huge display of bongs\u002Fpipes and store employees offering 'legal marijuana' for sale.  Our room was quite large, but the carpet was atrociously stained, as was one of the Queen mattresses.  No pull-backs for the curtains.  Large screen tv worked well.  There was a mini fridge and coffee maker.  Washroom had an awkward shape.  Towels were clean.  Toilet had a huge tank (not water-efficient) and threatened not to flush but fortunately did, just very slowly.  Doors were old, scratched and chipped, and not in a quaint old building way, but in a run down needs a renovation way.  Only one small garbage can in the room.  We could hear neighbors clearly through the walls.  The pool had grunge all around the perimeter above the water line.  Hot tub jets did not work and water was tepid at best.  The sauna had stains on the ceiling (mold?) and took forever to heat up.  Lots of towels at the pool and sauna  We couldn't find the gym, though we saw signs pointing to it.  Happily, there is a Tim Horton's across the parking lot, which was great in the morning and much more affordable than the restaurant on site.  We won't be returning.",3,negative

While it's true that this place could use a freshening up here and there (especially making the hotel room doors more soundproof), it can't be beat by the quality of the hotel staff. I know it's a clich\u00E9 that Canadians are nice, but it's really true here. Some examples...my first night, at 3 AM, some good ol' boys came on the floor talking and laughing loudly and making a racket. One call to the front desk and it got pretty quiet fast. The next morning I came down, probably with a look on my face, and the guys at the desk asked what was wrong - they could tell (I think I looked tired or something). They checked who had been near me the night before, and since one of the parties was staying a 2nd night, they put me in another room pronto, no questions asked. It was bigger and nicer. I really appreciated that. Beds were comfortable and the room has individual temperature control. The breakfast buffet was great, reasonably priced. The guys at the Concierge desk were so helpful in arranging my transportation back to the airport, and special shout-out to the guy who ran the small gift\u002Fsnack shop. All in all, their good nature and service really impressed me so much. So - if you're reading, hotel staff, my hat is off to you.",4,positive

(The brunch is excellent - great value and wonderful staff)   When my Father passed away I wanted to hold a Celebration of his life and the first place I called was the Delta Armouries. The people who work there and the quality of their food and service sets the bar for excellence.  \n\nI've never planned any event let alone something as important as a celebration of my Fathers life.  Brittany Labrie in the conference and event department guided me through the process and made excellent suggestions.  At one point I had to make menu selections and I confess I am no gourmand. All I can say is the choices Brittany recommend were excellent.  We had lots of food and very little left over...many guests commented on how great the food was.  We had a dedicated server for the event who silently moved about making sure everyone had what the needed and cleaned off tables as needed. She was a delight to have with us.\nI recommend the Delta Armouries to anyone looking to hold an event.  From planning to execution it was a success.",5,positive

Rooms were clean, spacious and had comfortable beds.  Pool area was quite nice, too.  The hotel is definitely full of ambiance and character.  \nThere were some extremely loud guest across the hall from us (in two rooms) and next door to us.  They had music playing, kept going between rooms and slamming doors, laughing and cheering loudly, etc.  I called the front desk at 1:00 a.m. to let them know . They sent us security.  They use a 3rd party security company, which proved to be absolutely useless.  The guard knocked on their door and told them to quiet down.  They said okay, and didn't quiet down at all.  The guard stood around for awhile and then went to leave the floor.  I opened my door and said, \""Are you kidding me?  You think this is acceptable?\""  He said he would try again . He knocked again and told them to quiet down.  They didn't.  I had to call the front desk THREE times.  The third time the guard came up he actually told the loud guests that it was our room complaining.  He pointed at our door and gave our room number to them.  Nice.

This was at 2:20 a.m.  I wasn't going to haul myself, husband and 2 kids and all of our stuff at 2:20 a.m.  The group finally went to bed at 3:00 a.m. so we had peace and quiet.  But this was at no help of the hotel.  I was disgusted at how it was handled.  We had to be up early the next day and faced a long drive with very little sleep.  We have stayed hundreds of nights at hotels and this was hands-down the worst experience we have had noise-wise.  We didn't feel as though we were valued guests.

Parking costs extra - I knew about that ahead of time, so no complaints, but downtown London is not exactly downtown Toronto, so I'm not sure why parking coasts are the same. You can choose valet for $20 or self-park for $13; we chose self-parking. The self-park lot is around the corner and uncovered, so OK for a nice sunny October weekend, not so much for snowy January or rainy April.\n\nWhen we checked out, there were a bunch of people waiting around for the valet, so I felt pretty good about our decision to self-park, until I found A SEVENTY DOLLAR TICKET ON MY WINDSHIELD. To be fair, the hotel took care of it with no fuss, but I had to wander back inside, stand in line, and wander back to the parking lot, just so they could do something that should be automatic. Counting the number of ticket's on *other* people's cars, I suspect our parking wasn't the only screw-up. Yeah, the extra 15 minutes isn't that big a deal, but c'mon: there's no reason for that.\n\nWith that out of the way, there were a lot of things to like about this hotel: it's right downtown, and I love how the old armory is incorporated into the hotel design. Rooms were comfortable and clean, although juuuuust getting dated (the hallway carpet had multiple huge bleachstains, but hey, hallway). It was really quiet all night. The bathroom was nice and large with good counterspace (often overlooked). Wifi was free, but erratic on checkin. The on-site restaurant (where we had breakfast) was very nice.\n\nOverall? Might try it again, once I get over my annoyance with their parking.",3,negative

Remember you are not at home, there are other guests.  Don't let your children run all over the hotel and play hockey in the halls!

We asked if we could be put on a floor without teams, but she said that there were teams on every floor, unless we wanted to upgrade to the club floor.

We rented 2 rooms as we had 2 teenagers and 2 young ones plus my husband, myself and a dog.  We were situated in 2 rooms next to each other (not adjoining) on the 5th floor.  Unfortunately - our stay was horrible.  Our rooms looked on to the 5 floor drop to the restaurant and reception area and the noise was unbelievably loud until around 2 am.  What was worse was that our room fan\u002Fcool air did not work and our room was about 85F all night.  At 1 am I called reception and they brought us a fan....but that was too loud for the kids to sleep.  So, unfortunately, our night existed of having kids and parents up and down all night from the heat and noise....just awful.\n\nIn the morning I formally complained to the Manager and she discounted our 1 room by 50% - always a nice gesture but it couldn't replace the misery of a tired family.  \n\nOther weird things at the hotel.....\n\nThe pool looks nice in the photo, but it was fairly foggy.  In addition, the handrail to get into the pool was broken. - and rusted.  In addition, they have someone guarding the pool towels so you cannot take a pool towel (shocker!) back to your room.  For those folks with kids - you can imagine how freezing it is for a child to head back to a room with no towel....of course at least they were cool before the room cooked us all! ;)\n\nThe valet parking person was nowhere to be seen when we got there.  We decided to park in the public parking lot instead - we saw the valet guy as he backed up someone else's car at lightning speed this morning and almost hit us as we checked out.....ridiculous.\n\nWe tried calling the bellman for advice on restaurants for dinner.....no answer.\n\nBreakfast was $12.95\u002Fperson for a buffet with only 4-5 items......at least the 3 and 6 year old ate free.\n\nOverall, I expected much more from Delta.  We visit London 3-4x per year - but we won't be staying there again !  \n\nOn the only plus side....it's a great location and I appreciated them trying to overcome the shortfall - but when you pay to sleep somewhere and you leave feeling like you are going to puke for lack of sleep....it's pretty atrocious.

The beds were comfortable, the room was clean and spacious, and there were a choice of firmness in pillows.  Our 8th floor room was reasonably quiet during our stay, with only the occasional morning disruption of a closing door from another nearby guest.\n\nWe enjoyed the coveted Sunday brunch.  Readers should know that the brunch is pricey, though there is a wide selection of foods from usual breakfast items with an omelette bar, to roast beef, salads, pasta bar, etc.  And the service was excellent.\n\nReaders should know that self-parking is uncovered and 1 small block away, and it costs an additional $15\u002Fday.  You can valet your vehicle for $25\u002Fday.  We opted for the self-parking option, and it takes about 3 minutes to walk to your vehicle.  Depending on the season, this may be a consideration to you with snow and rain falling.  In the summer, park your car so the morning sun is at the rear to help keep the interior cooler.\n\nDowntown London has some one-way streets, and many traffic lights are not traffic activated, so even though you're parked just a short walk away, it can sometimes take longer than the walk to drive back to the hotel to pick up others in your party.\n\nStaff at the front desk were friendly and as you'd expect with a brand name of Delta by Marriott.\n\nOne small one-off detail - the water on the upper-floor rooms was shut off between 10am and 4pm during our stay - we were originally assigned to an upper floor room, though asked to be moved to a lower floor room for this reason.  We were informed of this on check-in, which looks good on the Delta staff.\n\nThe hotel is located downtown and a short walk to shops.  Note that it's not near Western University, should you be visiting a friend or relative attending University, and is a 10-15 minute drive away.",5,positive

There is no bathtub in the redesigned bathroom, which I didn't mind, but my wife and mother did not appreciate.  I understand that most people only want a shower stall, but for seniors or persons used to a bath, it was a bit of a turn-off.    Also, the hotel restaurant, which I ate at several times during my stay, is very slow - painfully so.  The food quality is high, but for the price, the service should be slightly faster.  We were there at an off-peak time and our food took 1 hour to arrive, something that I wouldn't have thought possible.    I was there for both breakfast and dinner, and the service was terribly slow both times.  They also messed up my order.  Given the price, this sort of thing shouldn't happen.

For starters, the elevator is a very exciting elevator since it is glass and you can enjoy the view during your ride.  The rooms I have stayed in have been spacious, the beds comfy, linens soft, big comfy towels, and bathrooms clean clean clean.  The exercise room is spacious and there is an old school basketball court if you have an itch to see if you can still score on the court.  The pool and hot tub are set in a huge atrium like setting and can be quite wonderful when it is not too crowded-try going at about 6 am to find solitude.  I was disappointed on my last stay to find the hot tub ladder very loose, unsteady and downright unsafe - held together with duct tape!  (I did mention it to them in a survey they sent me in my email after my stay where they responded and said they plan to fix it - I hope they do.....).  Look for the historical items in the hallways lining the pool that help you remember you're in an old Armoury!  Parking is a bit of a hassle since it's a block away in a lot - I have never used the valet parking but my brother told me it takes a long time to get your car.  Most staff have been polite and helpful with the exception of the security officer who asked me during my last stay what was my business in the hotel when I was returning from a family dinner on a Saturday night - I was pretty insulted.  In the past I have had trouble with noise from other rooms where one time a bachelor party was next door to me and consequently I had to move to a second room where the heat was stuck on.  On the weekends there are usually events like weddings, fraternity parties, bachelor parties or regional youth hockey team events.  If you want to sleep in this hotel, ask for a room away from the ruckus.",4,positive

We were blessed to have 6 rooms in the old part of the building. All rooms were very large and decorated beautifully. The food in the restaurant was outstanding and the servers went above and beyond their jobs. The reason I only gave a 4 out of 5 is directly contributed to the number of kids running around the hotel unsupervised at all hours of the night. We have heard about hockey hotels but never experienced this before in this class of hotel. Our guests could not go into the pool as there were tonnes of screaming kids in it while their parents sat above drinking and not parenting. Maybe a time limit to when the kids can be in the pool and allow adults only after 9pm and have it a quiet area. It is such a magnificent hotel and the staff really do care about the stay for their guests. We understand hockey families need a place to stay, however maybe a compromise as to share the amenities with people who do not want to hear the shouting and enjoy their quiet time away. ",4,positive

So we wanted a hotel with walking access to Budweiser Gardens (concert venue). We also wanted a good quality hotel. Hence, the Delta London Armouries was perfect.\n\nFor starters, the location is impeccable. You have close proximity to the Budweiser Gardens, along with the various restaurants, yoga studios, quirky bookstores, etc. In fact, there was this cool looking Hungarian restaurant down the road. And London, Ontario is probably one of the few cities where you can still find a working payphone.\n\nIn addition, the amenities of the hotel were terrific. The hotel has a vintage feel, and it's an older building, but it is well-maintained. The pool and hot tub are really nice and have intriguing tiles on the walls and the floor. The hotel restaurant was great, as we ordered Quinoa with Truffle Oil and Mushrooms and Steak and Seafood. Oh, the dessert rocked, too. The hotel also offers on-site parking, which we needed. In addition, a one night hotel in this hotel was not expensive at all, compared to what you would pay in Toronto, and considering this is one of the top hotels in London.\n\nIn closing, I would highly recommend the Delta London Armouries.",5,positive

The room was modern, clean and nicely decorated.  I was on the 5th floor.  It cost more if you want a higher level.  I was in London for one night and did not plan to spend much time in the room.  \nAfter checking in, a friend and I wanted to eat some lunch at the restaurant in the lobby.  We had to wait quite a while to get service.  Eventually the front office had to call someone to find out why there was no one serving. Once the server arrived, she was pleasant and aware of gluten free restrictions. The food was disappointing.  I found it bland and not very appealing.  \nSleeping was not easy.  The bed was comfortable but it was very noisy with sirens sounding throughout the night.  I stayed at the hotel just before Christmas and it may have been worse than usual.  The other problem was the noise that came through the wall from the next room.  The neighbours were not particularly noisy but I could hear their television and their conversation as if they were in the same room.\n\nBooking the room was really disconcerting.  I went to what I thought was a Delta site and tried to book a room.  There seemed to be a problem with the date locator.  I clicked onto the date I wanted, which was the same day, and went through the process of booking a room.  At the end, there was no summary to review before the payment went through, and after I paid, it was evident that the date booked was for the next night.  I cancelled and tried again.  Unfortunately, it did it again.  It jumped from the night I wanted to the next night.  In addition, the rate quoted a free breakfast but when I went to pay, the breakfast was scored out.  I checked at the hotel, it was not included.\nFrustrated with the online process, I called the number on the screen and made the booking with a very polite person.  When I got to the hotel, I asked about a corporate rate and was told that I could not get it as I had booked through Expedia,  Nowhere did the website declare that it was Expedia, and the person I spoke to did not give that information.  I went back to the site and checked.  As far as I could see, and I searched, there are absolutely no indicators that identify the site as Expedia.  Now I am getting emails from Hotelsone asking me to review my booking with them.  I like to know who I am dealing with when I am making a transaction.  I also found it difficult to get a local phone number to call the hotel.  I would not stay at any Delta hotel again without being able to speak to the hotel, directly.

Yes, perhaps the furniture was a touch outdated but the TV was flat screen and there wasn't any obvious parts of the room in disrepair.

Firstly, let me say that it is still an excellent buffet, but very pricey now ( $ 32.95 pp, 29.95 for seniors--can't say price for children as don't have any that qualify for child pricing) . When we first started coming it was $ 19.95 per adult and the selection was much greater than it is now however there is still something to please everyone. There is both a hot and cold section, plus a very nice pasta bar and fresh omelette\u002Fegg station. They used to have huge shrimps prepared in butter , wine & garlic , now they are medium sized and you have to get them off the cold buffet and bring them to the pasta bar to be \""prepared\"" and they no longer add the wine or butter. I always ask for butter and they will accommodate by getting the kitchen to send some, but you have to wait. All the salads are very good, and they have very delicious smoked salmon. If you like it the \"" Jewish way\"" you will have to ask your table server to bring you cream cheese, but they do have capers, lemon and onions there at the cold buffet. The hot table selection changes throughout the season but generally there is always a huge roast and ham or similar, plus fish, chicken  and assorted vegetables. The cold salads are very nice- we especially enjoy the Greek salad. Desserts are not as plentiful as they used to be and I recommend that if you see a cake that you would like a slice of to get it early as often they are replaced by something different when they run out. One nice addition to the hot desserts besides the traditional waffles are the cheese blinzes- delicious. Try them with some fruit sauce and whipping cream. Be warned, the cream that is out by the desserts is the edible oil product, not the real stuff., so again you have to ask your server to bring real ( dairy) whipping cream and they will do so. Of course, juices, coffee, and assorted tea is included in the price ( although in some buffets they are extra now!) . Our favourite place to eat used to be upstairs, which has fewer people, where  you can oversea the main buffet, but due to a handicapped member we now enjoy sitting in the gunnery room near the fireplace which is also very nice, but more has ore people. One nice feature , besides the fountain, is the live music which is always very pleasant- they will even come to your table and play a song for a special occasion.\nOverall, despite the high price, we still enjoy coming here and are always pleased with the food and service. It's expensive, but a nice treat to do every once in a while.  \nPS- I don't recommend coming during the \"" special dates\"" such as Christmas, Easter, Mother's Day, etc as the price goes up, the menu is basically the same with perhaps a small change or addition for the season, and the service goes down as the restaurant is very , very crowed- go the week before or after for a more enjoyable experience, even if the menu is not \"" seasonal\""- it will still have some aspect of the holiday that you will find.",4,positive

The hotel was chosen by my cousin who was getting married and wanted the bridal party to stay at the same hotel.\n\nAs the bridesmaids and I were getting our hair and make-up done in my room, I got a Signature Club room which is slightly bigger than a standard size. The room was spacious and clean. I was on the 19th floor and had a nice view. However, the carpet has big red\u002Fpink stains, one of the lamps had to lean against the wall in order to stand as the base was broken. One of the phones didn't work. My family also stayed at the Delta and said their phone didn't work either. The bathroom fixtures were outdated. The power outlets in the bathroom didn't work which was really inconvenient. It would have been nice to be able to get ready in the bathroom since my room was already crowded (hairdresser, make up artists and bridal party). I called the front desk to let them know about the issue and asked if they could bring an extension cord. They did bring one however, it wasn't long enough to go all the way in the bathroom. When checking out, I mentioned to the front desk that the power outlets in my bathroom didn't work and was told that there is a switch in the hallway that controls all the power outlets in the bathrooms on my floor and that when switched off, none of them work. I wasn't happy to find out that someone could have easily fixed the problem when I first brought it up to them. I haven't seen the switch in the hallway but the front desk agent made it sound like it is a switch that can easily be switched off by accident. If that is the case, this is something that should be changed.\n\nMy room had complimentary breakfast included. Breakfast was not bad (English muffins, bagels, pastries, cereal, hard boiled eggs, granola bars, fruits, coffee, tea and juice). However, the Signature Lounge (where they serve breakfast) was small and crowded.\n\nAs for self parking, I was told to simply park my car and register my license plate at the front desk. I was told parking was $12\u002Fday. However when I paid for parking at the kiosk, I was charged $30 (to park from Friday 11pm to Sunday 8am). When checking out, I found out my final bill had $24 parking fees. I told the man at the front desk that I had already paid at the kiosk and showed him my receipt so he removed the charges. However, I told him that I was charged more ($30 at the kiosk vs $24) and he said that since I had paid at the kiosk, he couldn't refund me. I told him that I was never told that I didn't have to pay at the kiosk since I was a hotel guest and that I would instead be charged on my final hotel bill. Talking to the other bridesmaids, I realized that I was not the only one who had not been properly informed.\n\nThe hotel staff was nice however I feel like there was a lack of communication and training. Some of the issues I had could have easily been fixed if the staff would have been properly trained.\n\nI would not recommend this hotel.",3,negative

We were on our way to Niagara Falls from the Chicago area and thought this would be a nice stopping point for an overnight stay.  We were very pleased with our choice.  We based our choice on viewing the reviews on Tripadvisor and its location to the restaurant we wanted to dine at (also based on reviews on Tripadvisor).\n\nThe location is simply the location.  It is a downtown area of a small city.  Nothing particularly exciting about it.  It was a pleasant town to walk around in, however much like any city, there is a less desirable area.  We didn't have any problem walking around during the day...locating the restaurant we had chosen.  Being what we hoped were smart travelers, we asked the staff if it was safe to walk at night.  They agreed it was, however they changed our route to make it the safest way possible.  We dined at \""The Only on King\"" which was only a few blocks from the hotel.  \n\nThe room we stayed in was their premium category.  It was clean with a nice view of the city.  The hotel is older.  The only challenge we had with the room was that it was a too warm.  We like it quite cool to sleep, and we could not get the room cold enough.  Other than that, it was quite pleasant.   The only negative comment we could make was that they need better cushions on the bar stools in the lounge.  Their a bit flat on metal chairs.  \n\nNow to the best part of our stay...the staff.  They were fabulous.  From the moment we pulled in, the bellman and valet were so personable and friendly.  We spent some time at the lounge.  Lisa was the bartender.  She was pleasant and attentive.

I am from a military family, so this was very cool to me. My Dad spoke of this Armoury many times during his military career. I finally had the opportunity to stay at the hotel & experience the Armoury, well at least the original walls. :)\nIf you are interested in the military history of this property, there is even a mini museum on the 2nd floor. Very well done.\nI was extremely impressed with the excellent customer service at this hotel from customer check-in, the housekeeping staff, to check-out. I was made to feel special & welcome from the time I arrived to the time I left, even though my stay was very short. The level of professional, friendly service was exceptional.\nMy room, recently renovated, was spacious & had everything I needed. I wish I knew the names of everyone who served me, because I would list all of them in this review.\nHowever, one name stands out from the rest. Marguerite, one of the housekeeping staff went over & above for me & provided a bath chair for the bathtub. I have some minor mobility issues, so she pleasantly suggested that she bring me this bath chair. I travel a lot for work & rarely experience this level of kindness & caring.\nThere is a pool & a hot tub on the second floor. I mainly used the hot tub & thought it was a real treat on a cold, snowy winter Saturday in London.\nI had lunch & dinner at the Armouries Grille on the Saturday. The servers were extremely attentive to my food allergies. Very much appreciated. Both meals were excellent. I would highly recommend the plated roast beef which they serve on Saturday evenings. \nI will definitely return to the Delta Armouries Hotel in London--- for a longer visit next time. :)",5,positive

The room was large, well-appointed and designed for the business traveler.  \n\nCustomer service was fantastic -- I experienced a few issues with the room and the front desk staff got onto solving the issues right in front of me.  Housekeeping was great.  \n\nBathroom had no tub, just a shower, but that was fine with me.

It was mid-June and we Canadians like to start feeling warm in this season. It turns out, after two experts were sent to our room, that the air-conditioning was faulty.

Some of the function rooms seemed to require a few steps as well.   I debating penalizing for this but in the end I decided not to as its obvious local codes allow for it, although I think as a branded hotel they should try to be more accessible.  In the end, I decided to keep the roundup and consider this an advisory.\n\nAbout my system - All scores are based on expectations, where 7.5 = met expectations, 10 is highly exceeded, and 1, well, something went horribly wrong. Expectations take into account a number of factors, such as price paid, brand, and location. They will vary greatly from the Waldorf Astoria to a Super 8.

We were going to be relocating to London. We came in February to look for housing. We arrived in Toronto much later than anticipated due to problems with our flight. When we called the hosts, they were extremely kind and accommodating. Our room was still ready for us, and we were able to rest on what seemed to be the most comfortable bed in the world, after nightmarish transatlantic travel. The breakfast next morning was relaxing, and we were able to ease into what could have been a very stressful week. The hosts were very generous with their time and offered us very helpful house-hunting tips and general information on the city. After lots of viewings all day, it was always nice to come 'home' to friendly and welcoming faces. We had a very successful week, and this was in large part due to the comfortable stay we had at Rosneath. We returned in April and stayed at the B&B for two weeks. We were offered a good rate due to the longer stay, and our anxieties and worries about the big transatlantic move were calmed thanks again to our stay at Rosneath. We never could have imagined a smoother transition into our new life. We will forever be thankful to the hosts for their resourcefulness. But since this is after all a B&B review, I must add that we also found the room to be very comfortable, having all the necessary amenities. We found the walk to downtown very pleasant. We found the breakfasts to be healthy, and they got us off to a good start in the mornings. We occasionally used the kitchen to prepare some light meals since two weeks is a long time to be eating restaurant meals! This was not a problem. \nThis is a charming B&B. Even though London isn't particularly a tourist destination, your stay here might just make you feel like you are relaxing in a far-off land and yet feel at home at the same time. Happy travels!",5,positive

data/ca/154995/1718981/434143404.html,Hotel Metro,"""This hotel although cute and quaint was not ideal for someone visiting on business. \n\nThere is no parking and rather than offer to have someone come out and pick up your luggage, they expect you to bring your luggage in, check in and then go back out with some paper map to find the parking lot. (it was difficult to find because London has a few one way streets and no right or left turns at certain times). I had to wait for a while before someone came to desk so that i could check in. \n\nThey do not offer breakfast which is one of the things that make a hotel convenient while traveling for business and needing to get moving early. There is breakfast offered at a sit down restaurant next door if you find yourself with the extra time. \n\nThe room was spacious and well decorated however it had no window and was very dark. I asked for a change of room as this was quite unnerving and they weren't able to accommodate. The bed as a murphy bed it seemed which was a bit odd. The AC fan was broken and made a loud fan belt noise so I had to turn it off and it got quite warm over night. \n\nThe room itself was clean however the elevator and hallways could have used a good vacuuming and less room fragrance spraying, the smell was a little bit like walking into a Hollister store. The hallways carpets were stained. \n\nI see good reviews of this hotel which is why I had chosen to stay, perhaps i caught them on an off day however from my experience it appears they have missed the mark of what makes a boutique hotel great. Boutique hotels should offer everything a chain hotel offers and then go one step further in design, convenience and warm service. The Hotel Metro only seemed to focus on the design aspect and sadly missed out on everything else.",2,negative
data/ca/154995/1718981/146780411.html,Hotel Metro,"""We stayed at Hotel Metro on November 30th and December 1st, 2012. We booked Hotel Metro through a third-party reservation service, which we have used many times before in other cities with excellent results and terrific value. That service gave the hotel 3.5 stars, which we would argue is at least 3 stars too many.\n\nThe first problem we encountered was being booked into a room with two double beds instead of a king-sized bed, which would be the default anywhere else. The girl at the front desk said we should have called beforehand to ensure our room selection; this in direct contradiction to what it said on our third-party reservation receipt. She then stated that we would not understand to do this because only people who work in the hospitality industry know this, which was insulting. \n\nUnfortunately, there were no other available rooms to put us in, so we made due with pushing the beds together. Big mistake. Pushing the beds together revealed a stained area on the carpet that looked and smelled like vomit, so we had to put one of the few bath towels down to cover it. The carpets in our room and in the third floor hallway were extremely dirty and stained, and desperately need to be replaced. The tile floor in the bathroom was also dirty and noticeably dusty around the edges.\n\nThe room itself was uncomfortably hot when we got there, but luckily we did figure out how to control the heat. The fan was extremely loud and annoying, as was the elevator, which caused a little earthquake every time it went by beside our room. The \""windows\"" faced inside the hotel, so the only view was down into a little banquet-type room; you could see directly into the other hotel rooms if the blinds were open.\n\nThe Hotel Metro's decor was tacky and drab, all done in dark greys and dark purple. It looked like a first-year interior design student's attempt to be hip and modern on an extremely low budget. The lighting in the room was stark and unpleasant; there were no table or floor lamps to create softer mood lighting.\n\nDespite putting out the \""do not disturb\"" sign on our door, the maid knocked on the door the morning after our first night to ask when we were checking out. We gently reminded her that our prepaid reservation was for two nights (unfortunately!).\n\nParking was a pain because it is located across the street from the hotel under the Covent Garden Market. Expect a bit of a drive around a couple of city blocks to get to it from the hotel because of the one-way streets. It is not included in the room, and the fee is paid directly to the lot attendant.\n\nThe hotel is located on a busy downtown London street, and is very hard to find because of small signs. There are entrances at the front and rear of the building, but both sides are pretty sketchy. On weekend nights, the whole area was swarming with loud drunk people. The club at the end of the block pumps music outside for the smokers' section, so we checked in to the tune of \""Gangnam Style\"".\n\nIn conclusion, we would never recommend this hotel to anyone, unless you are looking for a place in downtown London to bring a hooker.",1,negative

I was looking for something close by with overnight parking access; basically a decent place to sleep as I wouldn't have time for tourism or amenities. I was sold on the location - a short walk to the theatre and across the street from Covent Market - and the pictures looked great. The price was also a great value. But what sold me was the quality of my exchanges with Guest Services when asking questions. Imagine my joy when I found that the hotel was even better than it looked on the web.\n\nI chose a lower floor room with no exterior view and a Murphy Bed because cost was my defining factor and I just needed to sleep and then travel home. Trust me - the room was perfect and the bed was very comfortable. So if the \""upper tier\"" rooms are not available, do not fret. \n\nThe room was quiet, spotless and spacious with generous seating options and a Euro open-space tub\u002Ftoilet\u002Fsink configuration (a full curtain available for conversion to privacy if that's not appropriate for you). Good size fridge, free bottled water and Keurig, flat screen w\u002Fcable, bathrobes and more towels that you need. Tons of great amenities a la carte (I did not have time) and a room service menu with very reasonable prices (I did not use that or eat at the attached bar\u002Frestaurant). Elevator is a good size and quick, stairwells clean and well lit, entry in front and at rear of hotel.\n\nLocation is perfect - you are within walking distance of everything, and the market across the street has anything you want - groceries, bakery, ethnic food, deli, candy. Parking is easy - you can buy a prepaid 24 hour card from Metro at a discount and add to your bill. Neighborhood is safe, and London night life on weekend is active until 3am. If you don't use your mobile device, the street map provided in your room is all you need. I wish I had time to really see the city, but the concert was spectacular.\n\nLittle things make the difference - like the pre-arrival emailed confirmations with directions and parking info and other helpful tips. And they offer free telephone calls within North America; I was able to touch base with family and friends without using roaming or added travel fees on my cell.\n\nBut most importantly, the staff - from first emailed question to arrival to checkout it was nothing but helpful interaction and a pride in their work that was the textbook definition of a \""warm welcome\"".

The area is changing from vacant shops and kids sleeping in doorways to one of new shops for hipsters, restaurants, wine bars and sports bars. Don't get me wrong, the neighborhood is safe, and at no time did we feel threatened. The market across the street is massive with all sorts of shops\u002Fstalls for bakery goods, green groceries, wines, and restaurants. Just down the block is Budweiser Gardens where, in season, there are basketball and hockey games, as well as concerts. The hotel is clean and secure. It maintains its \""cool\"" in the rooms by having a soaker tub in the open, as well as a semi-private rain shower. The toilet is private, by the way. The bed is comfortable. A Keurig machine and coffee cartridges make it easy for your wake-up in the morning. Parking is available, but you have to drive in a round-about route to get there with all the construction going on. You can pre-pay for 24-hrs of parking at the hotel desk. It's a substantial discount. Finally, a note of advice to my fellow Americans - check out the Canadian calendar.

Due to this, it\u2019s a great choice for a traveller who wants to be close to VIA rail, greyhound, 15min away from north, southwest and east side of London. Outside of its doorsteps is Budweiser Gardens and the best nail salon for shellac mani\u002Fpedis, waxing, eyelash extensions and more at Covent Market Nails. In front of the hotel is the Covent Market with fresh produce, meats and authentic diverse take-out and sit in food places like sushi, greek, East Indian food to name a few. Surrounded by the hotel is a vast assortment of local fine dining restaurants, craft gastric restos, beer brewery for flights of beer, wine restaurants with flights of wine. Don\u2019t want to leave the restaurant? Gnosh restaurant is connected to the hotel. They make the best cocktails, serve great craft beers and the ingredients are likely sourced fresh from the market. The charcuterie board is our favourite.\n\n.: Hotel Suites\nMy husband and I got married on Halloween in the hotel\u2019s atrium and had our dinner reception at Gnosh. Because of this we always request to stay in the same suite during the same time of the year to celebrate our anniversary. The king suite is incredibly spacious, the pictures are true to what you see in person. The styling is lux and thoughtful from the 2 person soaker modern tub, the spacious shower (no door on shower  \uD83D\uDE09\uD83D\uDE09) and the rectangle vessel sink matches with the tub. There is no bathroom door except to the toilet as the bedroom and bathroom is open concept. No worries though because there is a long wall to create a foyer space to give privacy from the bed and bathroom from the main entrance to the suite. Wearing one of the robes completes the boutique hotel spa feel. The usual in room amenities are there too like the big screen tv, blow dryer, hotel shampoos\u002Fconditioner\u002Flotion\u002Fsoap\u002Fetc. Have a special occasion? They have a long amenity list from candles, Epson salts, rose petals and more. Sorry, no gym or pool but be sure to try out their coffee\u002Ftea machine in the hotel lobby that makes the best coffee\u002Ftea lattes and cappuccino\u2019s. No worries, they also have keurig machines in every suite. Also in the lobby, you\u2019ll fine refreshments of chilled juice and apples to snack on. Tip; ask the concierge for their list on available board games!\n\n.: Overall Rating\n5 stars all the way from concierge, cleanliness, proximity to local cuisines and bars, this is the best hotel to experience an alternative to the usual cookie cutter hotel chains.\n\nThank you Hotel Metro staff for making our annual getaway always so memorable.",5,positive

The service was very welcoming and helpful. My bf was looking for parking that wasn't too expensive and the guy at the reception desk gave us a specific direction on how to get there. \n\nWhen we got to the room, it pretty much looked like a loft and felt cozy. It was an open concept, meaning the shower and tub was not in a separate room but the toilet was (exactly how the pictures look like). I personally felt like this hotel was meant for couples and not so much family only because it was just one giant room and had little privacy.\n\nWe got a king size bed and let's just say, I was sleeping like a starfish all night (my bf didn't mind haha). I guess that's how comfortable and satisfied I was with the bed. \nOutside of our room was a massive festival filled with concerts and such, and let me tell you, even having 3 windows I heard none of it! :)\n\nThere was one thing I want to point out, at night when we were about to sleep the AC kept turning on, making noise. But it wasn't annoying, more like a background noise. But otherwise, I'm definitely glad that I picked this hotel and looking forward to coming back ;) \n\n-On a side note, the hotel does offer more of a romantic ambiance in your room (such as strawberry dipped chocolate, rose petals, candles etc) only for a little extra charge.

Someone has gone to a lot of trouble with the furnishings and treatments of the rooms. A beautiful decorator palette of gray, purple and green leaves you feeling relaxed, yet festive enough to hold your own party. The textures of brushed wood and exposed brick give you the feeling you are in a building with history, not the usual beige box that most hotels offer.  There are carefully placed reading materials on art and Princess Diana, which adds class and speaks to culture. The tub and shower are heavenly and beckon you in the open concept layout.  There are two fuzzy robes to drown your body in, as well as ample room at the sink.  Some other nice touches include a hangtag on the door offering suggestions for quiet activities (very refreshing!), a small fridge, and wonderful people at the receptionist desk that will help you with all things and remember you.

data/ca/154995/1718981/462221829.html,Hotel Metro,"""I've stayed here a good number of times over the years, and have always loved the Metro.  The location is fantastic - downtown, and right across from the market - and the price is totally reasonable for a hotel room in London.  I also love the open concept rooms and the huge, deep bathtub.\nMy most recent visit, though, made me think that perhaps it's time to find a new favourite London hotel.  First thing that bothered me was I went to hang up my coat; I guess I've never worn a long coat to this hotel before, because the limited space allotted for hanging clothes is over a shelving unit, so only short garments can be hung.  There's about a foot of space and two hangers for long items down the side of the shelving, but it's occupied by the hotel bathrobes... sure, I could have tossed them somewhere else (and did) but I'd rather have a bit more space to hang stuff.  Then I went to make myself a coffee from the Keurig (hate them but that's neither here nor there, every hotel now has them) and realized there was no milk or cream.  There were two bottles of water provided, presumably to make coffee, and it would not have been terribly onerous for staff to also chuck a few creamers and milkettes in the little fridge.  \nOther minor irritations:  the little Metro sticker on the toilet paper, presumably to hold the little courtesy fold thing in place, because why else would it be there?  It's not like I need proof that the paper is unused - it's on the roll.  The toilet is in a separate cubicle and there's no wastebasket in there, so no way to dispose of the stupid sticker until you exit the toilet room... just seems strange to me.  \nThe lighting in the room is inadequate for reading, and the light level in the room is pretty low in general.  There are lights provided, don't get me wrong; there is a bedside light on one side of the bed (however, it's an angled desk light so is like reading during an inquisition) as well as a row of lights above the bed, but they do NOT work for reading because they are angled in a way that ensures your book is in your shadow.  There is also a light beside a chair but it's not bright enough to read and yes, I did turn it up all the way.  The light over the bathroom sink is also not very bright, and the deck around the sink holds towels and hotel toiletries, so you can either move their stuff to put your stuff there, or put your stuff somewhere else.  Admittedly minor for most people, but I read a lot, I have low vision, and good lighting is important to me.\nThe seating in the room isn't really that comfortable.  The molded plastic white chair is probably the most comfortable seat in the joint.  The square upholstered chair is like a medieval torture device, and the office chair is... well, it's an office chair.\nThe pillows are absolutely awful - hard and very thick.  I usually sleep like a log but those pillows had me tossing and turning all night.  The bed is comfortable but the sheets are tucked in so low down on the bed that you have to yank everything out before sleeping unless you are less than 4' tall.  \nAgain, just one, or maybe even two, of these things wouldn't put me off a hotel, but when I add them up, I'm not happy.  We did mention the pillows when we checked out and were asked how everything was, and were told that the pillows were hypoallergenic... didn't exactly inspire me to complain about anything else.  \nSo, yeah.  The Metro is a nice property, but I think I'll start looking around for some place that can better meet my needs.  For you, it might be just right, so give it at least one shot, and let the rest of us know what you think!",3,negative

We had dinner downstairs in the restaurant attached to the hotel, the service was excellent, the food was delicious and the portion sizes were huge. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful as soon as we walked in the door. While at dinner I had the staff place rose petals,champagne, chocolate, and candles all around the room.

We kind of got the runaround from the front desk on the issue, as well, finally being told as we checked out that someone was on their way to fix it.

It takes little getting used to having the tub and shower in the same space as the bed, but that's part of the unique character. The bed was comfy, the curtains blacked out the room, the internet was a decent speed for a hotel, the TV was hi-res and even the in-room k-cup coffee was good. The toiletries' fragrance and quality underscored the hotel's intent. Bare floors for those who are allergen-conscious. My only itch was the over-bed lighting - bright spots might deter the partner who does not read in bed. Focused gooseneck lamps might have been a fix for that.

The rooms are wonderful, very modern, relatively minimalist and nicely decorated. The layout of the room is open in that the soaker tub and shower area are in the main room. There is a water closet with a door so you don't have to worry about that aspect. The Aveda toiletries were wonderful. The hotel includes a great restaurant with very good food and great prices but only open for lunch and dinner. The hotel is right across the street from Covent market so I just went over in the afternoon and bought some pastries and fruits etc. and stored them in the fridge for breakfast the next day. The hotel offered to supply me with a microwave just in case I wanted to heat something up but I didn't require it. They have a Keurig coffeemaker in the room so I brought my own Starbucks pods but they have regular, decaf and French Vanilla plus green tea in unlimited supplies.\n\nThe service was outstanding, reception and housekeeping stff very friendly and quick. \n\nParking is under the market, with the entry on King St. There is a half hour loading area in front of the hotel but if you're not familiar with London's one way streets, get very good directions from the reception to get back onto King (a one way street).",4,positive

It reminds me of the Kimpton Chain. Tastefully decorated, soft loft feel, modern amenities, free water and comfortable robes.  Queen room was large.  Much different style than the more established hotels in the area which are very demode.  Wifi was free and worked well.  Although I was near the elevator, I hardly heard any noise.\n\nThe location is great if you take greyhound or even via.  It is literally across the street from the market and on Dundas near RIchmond.\n\nMy only complaints are that my suite was dusty because I don't think it had been used for a while and the bathroom fan is a bit loud.  I turned off the AC and that shut it off.\n\nI stayed in a Queen Suite.  It was facing the atrium, so there was no view.  I really couldn't care less as I was staying for work, but if you are someone who needs a view, the view of the Atrium from the fourth floor will not work for you.\n\nThe Queen street is ideal if you are travelling as a couple and one spouse is working and is not.  There is a den and work desk on one side and there is a partition separating it from the bed on the other side.  The television is in the centre and has an articulated arm, so it can be adjusted.\n\nMy other non-suite complaints are the elevator and the entrance.  The elevator was dirty and smelly.  They need to clean those more often. The front entrance has a weird ramp for luggage only.  There is a back entrance on Richmond street, but you need your key first in order to enter there. So, not sure sure how disabled accessible this hotel is.\n\nUnfortunately, this hotel does not offer a complimentary breakfast.  If it did, I would have given this a solid 4.5 stars.  Considering the rate is on par with the more established hotels in the area that do give breakfast, they should do this.   I found that the night staff that greeted me did her job, but did not really go above and beyond.  The morning staff was more enthusiastic. \n\nOverall, it was a good stay and I would stay there again for business.

Local eateries \u2013 The Early Bird and Blu Duby were both good recommendations from the Hotel.\n\nWhen booking I primarily had concerns about traffic noise on Dundas \u2013\u00A0the main strip, but was assured that this would not be an issue. However at 7 a.m. the construction noise of a large project across the street became an earlier morning rude awakening which was needless to say, disappointing. We did mention this to front desk on departure and  management followed up regarding our concerns with a credit on a portion of the bill. Much appreciated.\n\nBesides the construction issue across the street, there were some other concerns we expressed which may be of benefit to management to consider:\n\n1. Feather pillows as an option, or at the very least a softer, less thick \u002F stiff, poly version than the ones currently offered. Requested, but not available. They made for an uncomfortable sleep.\n\n2. Although we were assured the sink in our room wasn't plugged, it behaved as though it was, which made all sink functions from shaving, washing or brushing your teeth a concerning act of patience.\n\n3. Thirdly, while the room was spacious, well appointed in contemporary and had that lovely urban loft feel we like, the complete open concept presents some real challenges. Having the lights, sink, mirror, tub and shower openly exposed to the sleeping area creates logistical issues, if one is an early riser( and the other isn't ). While I get the romantic idea of the design \u002F layout, it fails the necessary privacy and practical side of invasiveness for someone sleeping.\n\nI understand the last point isn't easily addressed, but at the very least a drape might provide less disruption.\n\nI think this boutique hotel has something very unique to offer London visitors, and with a few tweaks it could really improve the guest experience. We understand the Fanshawe construction project across the street is somewhat out of their control, but good to know about in advance. Maybe a booking on the other side of the hotel would suit better.",3,negative

My car was moved (but not stolen) in the designated parking lot under Covent Garden and all items of value were taken.\n  The police and the owner were contacted.  Police responded, however I did not hear from the owner until I called the following afternoon.

I was also told that my room #206 was the least secure as it was right across from the stairwell.  \nPeople could enter the staircase to the hotel through the restaurant without being seen by from the front desk and could leave the same way undetected by cameras.\nThe communication from the owner has been disappointing.

The reason we share this pint size bit of personal information will become clearer as this review continues. Briefly, however, the medical appointments yielded discouraging results and combined with the travel, after which, we were desperately needing a hotel attuned to the importance of quiet, cleanliness, friendliness and rejuvenation. The dates of the medical appointments unfortunately coincided with a children\u2019s hockey tournament taking place in London. The initial hotel in which we were booked was noisy with children playing hockey with mini-sticks in the hallways, against room doors and some even using the elevator as a \u201Cgoalie net\u201D. The staff at the hotel seemed unable, if not unwilling, to recall that not of all of its guests were in the hockey tournament contingent and indeed some of its guests might actually appreciate not having to wade through seas of unattended children immersed in their hotel based hockey matches colliding into room doors in their exuberance. We left the initial hotel - hockey arena. With the majority of hotels booked for the weekend, there was one hotel to which we could turn and that we thought might keep a hold onto their \u201Caspiration of provid[ing] an exceptional level of service that will make for an unforgettable experience\u201D-- Hotel Metro. \n\nJust a walk thru the doors of Hotel Metro signaled we were entering an phenomenal space with the promise of a relaxing hotel experience.  Though the hour was late or early as it were, 2:00 in the morning to be exact, upon entry into the hotel we were warmly greeted by staff. Without request, personnel graciously moved from behind the reception desk and hurried to help us with our luggage as if we were being greeted by long time friends who were delighted for us to be there. We were invited to relax on the comfortable seats neighbouring the reception desk. With each passing minute, kind interaction, offer of warm beverage and efficient method of checking in we knew for certain that we had booked into a grand hotel.\n\nOur hotel room itself was impressively large and had gorgeous space made for bathing accompanied by a collection of Aveda products. Decision had to be made: collapse on the Vera Wang bed or luxuriate in the shower or tub. Among the amenities and also in our room was a large flat screen television as well an intriguing coffee table book, stylish contemporary cabinetry, gourmet coffee (in lobby and in room), blackout blinds, rainfall shower, thick and soft towels, free wi-fi and remarkable cleanliness, that should set the exceptional standard of clean for all hotels. Friendly, kind and polite staff and the amenities all combined gave rise to the spirit of relaxation we had sought from our hotel stay.\u2028\u2028Though we were not in London for sight seeing, notably the hotel is perfectly located for going to the Covent Garden Market\u002FLondon Farmers\u2019 Market that sits across the road and we noticed many interesting sounding restaurants in the immediate vicinity. There is also a restaurant attached to the hotel, which we were unable to try but we imagine that the service and food would have been spectacular given its connection to the hotel.\n\nQuite simply, if elegant, spacious and spotless surroundings with attentive and caring staff are factors in your selection of hotels, we highly recommend Hotel Metro. During our stay we were treated as valued, welcomed patrons whose needs were thoughtfully anticipated. Kind and friendly staff strive to ensure that hotel will provide an atmosphere that values you, as their customer, and an environment that makes possible a quiet, relaxing, rejuvenating and luxuriating hotel stay. Our only disappointment was that that we were unable to change our departure date. We look forward to a return trip to the Hotel Metro to be among friendly, welcoming staff--and to relax.

This little boutique hotel is now at the top of my list of places to stay in London!  \n\nThere are a number of things that make this hotel stand out:\n- location: it is right downtown with close and easy access to many restaurants, shops, running trails and transportation\n- room amenities: in-room coffee maker (Keurig), free wifi, Aveda bath products, comfy mattress and pillows\n- staff: from the moment I walked in until the moment I left, I received personal and enthusiastic service by the staff.  SInce this is a small hotel, they are much more hands on that at bigger hotels and get to know the guests a little more.  (A big thanks to Jamie and Rob especially who were both integral in making this a fabulous stay!)\n\nOf course, there are a few things to take note of:\n- the rooms are open concept, so there is no door to the bathroom or shower or tub, just a door to the WC.  Now, for a solo business traveler, this is not a problem at all, but  for anyone sharing a room who is a little modest, this might be a shock.\n- as with most hotels, whoever designed some of the room features was most certainly designing for men and not female travelers.  For example, there was very narrow space to hang long clothing like a dress.  The wardrobe is designed for hanging shirts and folded pants.  Also, the lighting in the room was good, except the wattage over the sink\u002Fcountertop was very low, which makes it challenging to apply make-up or style your hair.\n- there is no in hotel breakfast served, however there are multiple coffee shops and breakfast places within one block walk.\n\nOverall, the plusses of this little gem far outweigh any suggestions I may have for improvement, and I will definitely stay here the next time I am in London.

Despite some of the drugged or homeless people that roam the streets in the area, the hotel was well secured and clean. One word of advice, get to the drug store before 9 or 10pm, before it closes if you need anything. I was told they closed so early on a Friday night because of crime in the area, but I did not feel unsafe at all in this part of the City. We even went out late night at 2am after the wedding Saturday, and there were quite a few people on the town for a good time. All in all I was really impressed with this hotel and its location.

We had nothing but great service from the time we booked our room online to the time we left. Jamie and Danica helped confirm the details of our room via email in a very timely manner, which was especially helpful as we were visiting from Mississauga so that was much appreciated. \n\nBiggest shout out goes to Kendra for her exceptional service upon our arrival. She is warm and very friendly. She prepped our room with rose petals (as per our request) but also surprised us with a complimentary bottle of wine, which was a perfect touch. The room we stayed in (room 202) had high-ceiling, was spacious, overlooked the marketplace and we loved it. The soaker tub was huge and made for great bubble baths. If you appreciate a different twist in your floor-plan and don't mind the open-concept, loft-influenced architecture that makes this hotel stand out from others, then this would be great for you. We normally sleep in a king and opted for a twin this time but the bed was so comfy and was made with a lightweight duvet that it actually didn't matter for us (which is slightly surprising as we are both very different sleepers). The keurig machine in the room offering a good selection was a nice touch. The lobby also has a coffee machine and serves some interesting juice-infused water, which offers a welcoming space when you enter.\n\nThe hotel is also really good about providing for specific needs, whether you're traveling solo or as a couple or a family, on business or recreation.

I was in London to attend a conference, and since the Hilton ran out of its conference-priced rooms, I looked around and found a treasure!  I was the envy of my conference friends.\n\nMy room (401) had a wonderful view of the Covent Market and the open skyline above the market.  Because the weather varied (gray & rainy to sparkling blue with white billowing clouds), the view varied a lot and made the already spacious room seem even more spacious.  The bed is wonderful; I was relaxed and able both to work and to sleep (and watch a disastrous Dodgers game).\n\nThe front-desk staff are all \u201Cpleasant,\u201D \u201Cefficient,\u201D and \u201Caccommodating,\u201D words that you could use of the staff at the Hilton, too, where I attended a conference, but there\u2019s an engaging difference at the Metro Hotel: you get the sense that the staff has joined their self-interest with yours.  They will help you out with whatever you need if they can.  Although there is no business center, the staff person assured me that I would be able to get a conference paper printed.  And I did (between 6:45 and 7:00 a.m.)  I borrowed an umbrella (not uncommon at a hotel) and a connecting cord to charge my i-phone (this is not a listed service but exemplifies the spirit of the staff, who look for ways to say \u201Cyes\u201D to requests).  The people who work at Hotel Metro are committed to the hotel\u2019s aims but they don\u2019t seem \u201Ccorprotized.\u201D  I have special praise for Brook, Rob, Jamie, Danica, and Lia.  Thank you!\n\nCovent Market across the street is worth checking out if instead of going to a restaurant for every meal you want to eat fresh fruit & vegetables, Tapenade, a serious variety of breads & cheeses (as you would expect in Canada), and many prepared foods and salads.  The Metro\u2019s rooms have a refrigerator, so it\u2019s realistic to stock up a bit for breakfast and lunch.  There\u2019s also a liquor store on York Street beyond the Greyhound station where you can buy wine to accompany your vegetables and cheese. Then your room at the Metro becomes a wonderful space for relaxing, enjoying plenty, and looking at a changing view.\n\nClosely adjoining the Metro, you will find Blu Duby, a wonderful restaurant\u002Fbar, with an engaging bartender (if you\u2019re just in for wine) and a great menu if you want to stay for dinner.\n\nSome details: Attractive, modern d\u00E9cor (featuring black, grey, and white).  Oblong shower with a comfortable & comforting rain-flow showerhead.  Aveda shampoo\u002Fconditioner, etc., refilled daily (I kept my extra ones to take back to the homeless in Orange County.)  A K-cup coffee maker with a variety of coffees available all the time.  Refrigerator with 2 bottles of water resupplied every day.  Free long-distance phone calls in North America (really important if you\u2019re trying to avoid roaming charges but want to stay in touch with family).  Free wifi.\n\nP.S.

My husband was sick and I was not able to read in bed as there was only an overhead light. Also, couldn't see the coffee machine in the corner as there was no lamp. The closet was poorly designed. Could not hang clothes longer than a shirt as it was above the dresser. Fridge was installed in front of the mirror so couldn't use mirror. Bathroom had chunks out of the ceiling\ntiles and base boards were cut poorly. Tiles in shower (shower was actually a nice rain shower) were also poorly cut and installed.

Since it's relatively new, it still has a ways to go before it becomes a true, 5 star experience. I came here for my birthday and had a wonderful experience. Amazing boutique hotel for a very affordable price.\n\nLocation: \nLocation is central, right downtown. \n\nRooms: \nWe got the loft room (actually, we got a Marvelous Suite but my friends showed up early and upgraded it for me - it was my birthday) and it's a stunning room: clean, modern design, lovely accents, exposed brick wall. The bathtub is really comfortable and I like the open concept bath. I also like how the toilet gets its own separate room. The bed was huge and very comfortable. We slept great because the giant windows are covered by these amazingly thick, grey curtains. It was pitch black when we closed them. My only complaint is that there's no mini fridge, which was unfortunate because we had drinks and items that we wanted to keep chilled.\n\nService: \nUnfortunately, there was only one person there and every time we asked for something that we needed (fork, ice bucket, ice), this one guy had to do it and I think we had him running around the hotel helping us. (I'm certain that he was only there because when we checked in, he told us to hold on. We waited for about 15 minutes because he'd gone upstairs to arrange our romance package - candles, rose petals, some other goodies that my friends had left - and then returned. He was excellent and accomodating but it would've been better if the hotel had some more employees working.\n\nHotel: \nNot much in the actual hotel but there's lots to do around. \n\nFood:\nRoom service breakfast is complimentary. I imagine it's because there's no dining area.\n\nOnce the hotel figures out its kinks, I'm sure this place will be excellent. I would definitely return here again and am already recommending it to everyone I know.",4,positive

The cleaning staff have also always been super accommodating as I had a few overnight shifts back in November, and they made sure to adjust our room cleaning based on this schedule. The room was gorgeous as always and we absolutely loved the shower and bath. Being right next to the Covent Garden Market meant we were able to wake up and walk around indoors while enjoying various fresh foods. There's also a small little breakfast place just a few doors down from the Hotel, which meant that we were able to enjoy an amazing breakfast after saying good morning to the hotel staff without having to journey far.\n\nIn November, my partner had requested rose petals, candles, and a bottle of wine with glasses in our room after our dinner out for my birthday. The staff had the lights off in the room with a small desk lamp adjusted to create a very soft, warm lighting. It was absolutely breath-taking and it made my birthday extremely special.\n\nIf you are looking for a place to stay with your partner and want to go the extra mile, this hotel is the best there is.

On arrival we were greeted by a very lovely Lady with a big smile and very cheerful and professional. We were early but our room was ready and they surprised us with a wonderful bottle of wine in the room. The room was exactly like the photos on the internet and very clean and comfortable. My husband asked for the romantic package with rose petals and candles and it was all over the room when we came back from dinner as per his request. My husband had also ordered some flowers and the person at the front desk arranged them in a beautiful vase for us to use during our stay and brought them to our room promptly. We also had some appetizers ordered from room service menu to enjoy with our wine and it was delicious and delivered quickly by the Blu Duby Restaurant next door with complimentary glasses of champagne. This Hotel has so many extra little touches to make your stay more enjoyable like the terry cloth robes, free coffee and tea in the room with china cup to use, free bottled water in the fridge and all the good quality toiletries supplied not counting the beautiful lobby and corridors. The bed was very comfortable with good linen and we asked for soft pillows as the ones on the bed were a little hard for us and they changed them for very comfortable ones, we slept like King and Queen. This is the place to celebrate your Love or to reconnect as couple. We had a great Dinner next door at the Blu Duby which is also very romantic and classy at a reasonable price. As a plus this Hotel is so well located at a walking distance of everything downtown as well as the Greyhound bus and Via Rail Stations also local busses are at the door.

Having stayed in a number of boutique hotels in the past, I find them to be generally hit or miss, and online images can be deceiving in the best of cases. I will begin my saying that in the case of Hotel Metro, what you see online is exactly what you get when you arrive. When I walked into my hotel room, it was exactly what I had expected it to be - clean, funky, stylish, and a much different (and welcome) feel from our usual chain hotel stays. But while this hotel suits my style, this may not be for everyone - particularly those staying on business, where you are not set up with the traditional corporate-like desk & chair, and outlets to plug in your electronic devices are not readily in front of you. But if you are staying for pleasure, given the room and the location of the hotel, you honestly can't go wrong.",5,positive

The location of the hotel is ideal and the people at the front desk were pretty nice. However, these pros were heavily outweighed by the cons. Starting around midnight I had people banging on my door, slamming doors in other suites, and screaming. And I don't mean just talking loudly, I mean full on screaming. Girls screaming at the top of their lungs and men screaming profanities (sounded like some sort of fight). This lasted until around 5am. During this time the police came (not entirely sure why) and I only know that because the people in the room beside me were \""warning\"" the rest of the screaming people in the hotel. As a 21 year old girl staying by herself, I was terrified. I would not reccomend this place to anyone, and if I ever hear of someone planning to stay here I will immediately inform them of my experience. While I do agree with the statement \""you get what you pay for\"" I do not believe that my safety should be sacrificed because I spent a little less money than I would have if I stayed somewhere else. I've stayed at hotels that were cheap before and NEVER had an experience like this.

We had a quick check in only because there was no one else in line, as I only ever saw one employee there during our entire stay.  We received our two room keys for each of our rooms (we had two, as there were 8 of us planning to stay) and were instructed where to go for the parking garage.  The parking garage, while it was free was VERY tiny (if you had a large pick up truck there would be no way you would a) fit your truck through the door and b) be able to fit into ANY of the parking spaces.)  However, we did find a space and we continued up to our room.  We had some friends come visit that were not planning to stay at the hotel with us and they came to visit our room.  The guy at the front desk then called and asked to speak to my boyfriend, as the room was in his name, and was very rude, informed him that he watched us on the cameras (creepy) and saw four our friends come into our room and that our friends would have to leave because there are to be no more than 4 people in a room at anytime.  We tried to explain to him that our friends were not staying the night and that we were actually leaving for the hockey game in about 20 minutes but he hung up on us!

Perhaps their rooms are not outdated, dirty (dust, crumbs, dirt all along the edges of the floor, stains just under the sheet on the mattress pad etc.), loud (there were many loud noises occurring throughout the night, not caused by guests: such as what sounded like the flipping on and off of breakers throughout the hotel), and I would be willing to bet that EITHER of those other hotels have MUCH better service than we received.",2,negative

My daughter was a witness for a sexual assault on a minor. For her trial we would be there for 2 weeks. She and I checked in on June 10,2019. We paid for a full week right then, and the crowns prosecuting office was paying for the following week. At check-in, our hostess was Dana. She was very professional, courteous and understood our privacy issue and was accommodating. She gave my mother-n-law and I two keys to pick which room, 302 &303. While 302, was newly renovated, it didn't have 2 beds. It had a full size and a pullout couch. My daughter was going to be stressed out for obvious reasons, so I elected room 303. It had 2 bedrooms, both with full size beds. The room was slightly rundown, but for all appearance looked clean.\n   My daughter and I had bites on our sides, shoulders, feet, and elbows. We thought mosquitos were getting in the hotel room. We checked all the screens and there was no holes, but knew we were getting bitten. On June 13, 2019 I was lounging on the couch in the living room and was getting bitten by something in multiple places. At the same time my daughter calls me in to her room and says \u201Cthere is bugs on my bed\u201D. She points to these little bugs crawling on her bed and pillow. She then ask if they were bedbugs. She Googled bedbugs, without a doubt they were. They were stage 3 to adults. I grabbed the pillow went down to the front desk and said \u201Cwe have a problem\u201D, and showed him the pillow. He sighed and stated \u201Cwe knew room 303 had bedbugs, and we have tried treating it and you guys are the first people back in that room in a longtime\u201D. He called his night manager and said \u201Cwe have an emergency, room 303 still has bedbugs\u201D. He spoke with the manager and hung up. He then put us in a different room, and explained the room was rough, but as soon as housekeeping was done cleaning a new room in the morning we would be moved right away. indeed it was a very dirty room. Shower was broken, sink cabinet had a door hanging off, fridge was disgusting (but worked) the beds were so old they caved in, in the middle, carpets were stained with massive black stains. He gave us $5 in loonies and we were told to put our clothes in the dryer on high to make sure we killed anything that may have got on our clothes. He also refunded four nights for our troubles. I went back to room 303, and was shaking our clothes off before packing them. My daughter then noticed she still had the plastic mattress cover on her bed that they use to seal the mattress when treating bed bugs. By the time we got in bed that night it was 1am. \n   The next morning June 14,2019, I went to the front desk to make sure the word was passed along, because that room was disgusting. She said she was aware and she would call the room as soon as it was ready. About 30mins later there was a knock at our room and I opened the door. It was the front desk clerk. She asked to come in and speak to me, I let her in. She then proceeded to say \u201C I have to ask you to leave, for health reasons we can't have you here. We need to treat that room and can\u2019t do that with you here\u201D. I asked tons of questions for which she was honest and stated she didn't know why her manager was making her do this. She was shaking and crying she felt terrible. She knew why we were in the hotel to begin with and knew it would put my daughter at risk asking us to leave without notice or a plan. She then said \u201C you were supposed to leave last night\u201D. I said \u201Cno, that's not what we were told obviously if the message was passed down. Your treating me like I brought the bed bugs in here. The evening desk clerk told me that bed bugs have been a problem in that room and that we were the first guest in there since they tried treating the problem\u201D. She was then more upset, and I knew that this was not her doing. I called victim services who helped arrange an emergency hotel room in another hotel chain. I was refunded the remaining days. The manager that didn't have the audacity to do it himself, or even call to apologize to us went by the name Andy. \n    The other hotel then called my cell phone and told me some steps to take to make sure we didn't bring the vermin to their hotel. It did ruin several articles of clothing, washing and drying items on hot water and high heat for 30mins. Plus the spray that was needed to be done to our suitcases. They also got my daughter and I ointment for when we checked in, because you can get bad infections from bed bugs, which I did get on my elbow. The painful infection took 2 weeks to go away. \n    I was frustrated with the situation on night 1, but LES was doing what they could to help, solve, and reimburse the situation. However, the next morning, the manager showing his lack of respect or empathy to the situation that was created by his lack of managerial skills was appalling.  After getting in the new hotel, it cost me another $350, to buy more clothing for court, from articles being ruined. They were more than aware they had a bedbug problem, but were more concerned with greed then hotel guest safety.

The room was huge, full kitchen with microwave. I would say the only drawback is having the room facing Dundas St. You will hear people talking and traffic but that's no different than apartments that face the front.\nThere are some renovations going on so there is quite a bit of noise during the daytime, but are you spending that much time inside all day? I came to London for the Parkjam Festival Hip-Hop night and wanted a convenient, decent priced place to stay. This was perfect. A 15 min walk to Harris Park, there are places to eat nearby and Richmond Row where the nightlife is was a short 10 min walk. Also I took the Greyhound from Toronto and it was a 15 min walk from the Terminal to the London Extended Stay. The bed was comfy to sleep in. The sofa was great to sit on. I loved the balcony, sot there when I came back from the Festival and had some drinks. The area is relatively safe, there's foot traffic walking past the building as there is a 24 hrs Circle K convenience store just down the street. The panhandlers and drug addicts that roam around the corner where it is are harmless, as they don't bother people aggressively. It's a busy intersection as Wellington is a main street.\nThe staff at London Extended Stay are great. My only concern is the easy access to the building past the front desk late night. There should be a keycard access like most hotels have. This way not just anyone can walk in and go upstairs.\nThis place is on the top of my list to stay again in London when I attend any events. $125 for the night during a Festival compared to Holiday Inn next door that wanted $180 and Delta and Doubletree just a block away wanting about the same.

Due to the group overbooking in Double Tree I wasn't able to reserve my spot so I decided to looked around near Centennial Hall and came across London Extnded Stay. Despite for the bad past reviews, I took my chance and booked a one bedroom suite (Rm 200). The room itself is nice, it is way big for a one person. It has a complete kitchen with some basic kitchen utensils, a pot, a water boiler, coffee maker, pan, toaster,some plates, cups, mugs, fridge ,microwave and a stove. The only thing missing in the room is a standout mirror or a wall mirror to make it complete. It has a view of Dundas street from the balcony. However, the room is close to the elevator. LES elevator is vintage so when it opens and closes it seems like there is a rock dropping on the 3rd floor. Meaning it is a  noisy at night and kind of annoying especially when you are trying to get some sleep. My first night was awful. I did not sleep at all so on my second night, I went to the reception and asked for an extra blanket and a sheet because I decided to sleep in the couch instead and cover the door with a towel. It did help with the elevator noise so I sleep good on my last night. Another thing I saw in the morning when I open the curtains in the living room were dog hairs. I mean a lot of them. I did not see it when I arrive because I check in late so I only saw it the next day when I was doing yoga. I told the girl in the morning which I did not catch her name unfortunately, when she deliver the towels to sweep it or vacuum it when I leave which she did but there are still hairs all over. She only sweep, the one infront of the door and the ones I wiped on  the side with the badroom rug. I also told this issue with the guys in the reception which again I did not get their names. Missy in the reception was really nice though. She's the one who check me in and give me the sheet and blanket. She even give me extra fitted sheet and flat sheet which I don't need so I ended up returning to her. Dana is also helpful in  checking me out.\n\nA word of advice to the owner or operator of London Extended Stay. Please make sure that your supervisors checked the rooms before you hand it to your next guest as some guests are allergic to dogs or cat hairs and make sure to mapped it to catch the remaining hairs and the dust in the corners. Ensure that they also vacuum the wood  floors and not only the rug in the middle.I don't expect perfection but at least the dust and hairs under neat the table and chairs should not be noticeable. I understand that housekeeping have a very hard job and quota daily but customer satisfaction is a key in attracting  more revenue. In addition,  hallway carpets need a good vacuuming too. Ooh  by the way, my friend who stayed at LES too on June said that there's left over garbage  in their room when they check in so she decided to booked her room at the Holiday Inn next door this time. This kind of thing should not be missed.

Since you then can't park, you're forced to pay for parking in the city lot next door which requires you to pay $6 for the overnight price, but then wake up at 6 am to pay again or you get a $70 ticket.  \n\nWe got to our room and had to literally run our bodies into the door to get it to open because it stuck to the door frame.

This hotel is easily within walking distance from the Hall, as well as many other conveniences (ie. Tim Horton's, Banks, Convenience stores, etc.).  The hotel is under renovations, and from what I've seen this place has a lot of promise and potential.  The building essentially is like an apartment building, and suites have a full kitchen in them, which saved us a lot of money in terms of food.  It also made it feel more homelike during the competition, which was really nice.\n\nFirst and foremost, no matter what I feel about the hotel or about what happened during our stay, the front desk staff was amazing!  From the first person we met (Cassidy) to the last clerk we spoke to (Dana) and all the front desk staff in between (there were at least four others over the course of the weekend), we had a very positive experience.  We had a \""few\"" issues during the weekend, and each staff member took care of our needs with professionalism and care.  They engaged in conversation, and my daughter (age 9) grew quite fond of Cassidy who took interest in her dances.  We were actually sad that we didn't get a chance to say goodbye!  (So bye Cassidy, thank you for everything!)  It is because of them that we still had a wonderful stay.  \n\nI'm not going to go into great detail about any issues we had, the staff were made aware, and went above and beyond to rectify any problems we had.  Overall the stay wasn't a bad experience by any means, the hotel just needs to finish with their improvements and maybe make some changes.  The room wasn't the cleanest, but it wasn't gross by any means.  The beds were comfy, and when we were lacking one a cot was brought up.  When our AC was supposedly not working (it was a different issue all together), they brought us fans.  \n\nI would recommend or advise that anyone staying here remember a few things:\n-  The room itself does not have coffee for the coffee maker, however they do have coffee in the lobby.  Bring your own if you drink a lot of it.  - \n-  Remember your salt and pepper...we forgot...\n-  They currently do not have complimentary conditioner, bring your own.  But the shampoo is really nice, and smells like grapes!\n-  They supplied BASIC kitchenware, but if you're going to need a knife or more than a frying pan, pack it.  We prepared most of our food ahead of time, so that helped.  But it's something to be aware of.\n- The hotel does not have a pool or workout room, but no fear!  They do have YMCA passes for you.  I didn't go, my hubby and kids did...I don't remember if they had towels there.  Bring your own maybe just in case.  It's a really quick walk.\n- That part of London is a little sketchy.  Be safe, but it in no way reflects on the hotel.  As one of the night clerks stated, it's all on how you treat and talk to them.\n- The parking is not free, I don't know where people read that, but it's not.  But it's okay.  It's underground, you get in with your swipe card, and can come and go.  The elevator goes all the way down, so loading and unloading is out of the elements if needed.\n\nWe're usually in London once a year at minimum for a competition, and we will be back, to hopefully see all the renovations complete.

Im excited to see the progression of the renos and upgrades.\nFor the breakfast area: My only suggestion would be to maybe add a waffle maker.\nWe definatly will be back.\nBest of wishes to Shila and staff on bringing out the potential in this property...excited to see you all again.Thank you for making our trip memorable",4,positive

I have never posted a review for anything before but this was such a bad experience that i had to share, and warn the rest of you.  Our bathroom had not been cleaned from the previous guests, i know because there was stuff of the brown color in and around our toilet, hair everywhere including the shower wall and sink.  Toothpaste spit from the pevious guest was also still in the sink.  This being said i would have rather slept in the bathroom as it was the cleanest part of the room.  Our sheets were definitely not washed, they smelt like old man and had giant stains everywhere.  The icing on the cake were the giant white crusty circular stains on the chair, someone clearly did thier business at the desk.  We read on our welcom card that satisfaction is thier top priority and to let the front desk know of any issues.  When i told the nice man at the front desk our problem his answer was \""our rooms are clean\"".  When I asked him if he would like to come see he said \""I do not need to, our rooms are all clean\"".  I asked why he thought I would lie to him about these issues and he started to yell at me from behind the front desk infront of everyone in the lobby \""F... YOU, GO STAY AT A 5 STAR HOTEL OR BETTER YET A 10 STAR WOULD BE BETTER FOR PEOPLE LIKE YOU.\""  Hmm people like me, well if anyone else out there is like me and prefer to not have j.zz stains on thier chairs then the manager of this hotel does not want you there.

Entered room and found filthy sock left behind by previous guest on floor; pulled covers back on bed and long black hairs all over pillow and bed..should have left then..however in London overnight with busy afternoon and evening and made excuses to myself re aforementioned.

We weren\u2019t expecting much but it was even worse than we thought. My wife almost refused to stay after our arrival as the area is not a nice part of town, which made her very nervous. The lobby was dark, cramped, very dated and in rough repair. Check in was fairly quick and we were assigned a room on the first floor. After seeing water on the bathroom floor and a tap that would not shut off, we went back to the front desk to ask for another room. This request was quickly granted and the girl working the desk was very apologetic. Our next room was on the second floor and not much better than the first though no leaking plumbing. The room had decent amenities including a fridge, microwave, coffee machine, flat screen tv and iron with ironing board. Like the lobby, the room was also dark, dated, in poor shape all around and smelled of smoke. The bed was a queen, quite low to the floor and not very comfortable at all. My wife made the mistake of lifting the sheets and seeing several stains on the mattress cover. Once again she was not impressed. The AC worked well enough but was too cold in the end and we had to shut it off. We had a poor nights sleep due to being able to hear everything going on around us, including outside noise. The next morning my wife complained to the front desk staff and the manager. They were apologetic and gave us a reduced rate. That\u2019s the only reason I gave the place a rating of \u2018poor\u2019 rather than \u2018terrible\u2019.

The staffing levels were of course at a minimum as a result. What impressed us was the extent to which the staff would go to get what you need under these staffing conditions.  We ate in the lobby bar and the attendant was great - accomodating the many requests from our 3 year old - and also making it clear that given that we were the only people in the bar at the time that he was in a position to provide extra attentive service - which he did.\n\nOne of the neat perks of the hotel is having a resident Starbucks counter which I was eager to use when we awoke in the morning.  With the minisucle guest count they closed the Starbucks counter.  When I asked about how to get a cup of coffee they were soooo apologetic and again emphasized that they were in a position to do something special - they went into the kitchen and brought two cups of coffee in large take-out cups - and did so 'on the house'.  Some people would see this as small but \""how\"" they did this, so sincerely and apologetically, was impressive.  \n\nEven the lady that checked us out had a nice little banter with our son.\n\nThe staff made the difference for us.

I admit, I can count on one finger the number of times I've stayed at a 4 Points. \n\nThe problem, as it was a hot and humid August day, was the inefficient cooling system. I do adore all the environmental help Canada gives to the world. That said, no one messes with my AC! I had maintenance come out and it was explained to me that there was no AC, but it was a cooling system with water. Whatever. It wasn't close to cool enough. Thank God the kind maintenance man lent us his heavy duty fan! Even with the fan, I slept on top of the covers. \n\nBut once Summer is over, I think that problem will be over.

Front Desk and Restaurant staff are terrific but my only historical beef has been partially cleaned rooms. I like my Starwoods points but you have to draw the line at some point.\n\nRegretfully that old problem is creeping back. I've been staying here for over a dozen years and it goes through cycles that I try to work with management on to ensure a quality stay. However,I feel my wrttten and verbal feedback is ignored and a long time guest is taken for granted. In recent years 50% of the time I booked a Suite with Jacuzzi the tub jets were filled with debris and to dirty to use, add a multitude of annoying cleaning issues over time and my favorite place needs a rethink.    This last stay I regretted booking for 2 nights or I'd have left after the poor cleaning on day 1.   When I complain, the problem gets fixed that stay but keeps repeating needlessly with typically a dirty bathroom or living room. Often 80-90% of the room is fine and its baffling why the rest is skipped when I know policies are in place. I suspect the Cleaners are not given enough time per room to clean because the problems are not always the same Cleaners.   After repeated issues I've received no apology nor compensation like most Starwood properties do when a stay is devalued by a bad experience.   I hope management gets the Cleaning act together as I've been avoiding the place using the downtown Delta instead where I've only had 1 cleaning issue in over a dozen years at the Delta so I know bad cleaning is avoidable.\n\nA good stay begins and ends with a Clean room...Its the least expensive thing a hotel can do to keep guests coming back ,or the most expensive mistake they can make to drive quests away.",2,negative

If we didn't stay at one of their \""specified hotels\"" we were not allowed to enter the tournament.\n\nThe hotel covers a very large area, with a five story tower at the front, and a two story section that stretches waaaay back in the property.  Our group of 17 rooms were scattered from the fifth story to the way-back.  Shame on the hotel for scattering a group when our block had been reserved in July for a late September arrival.\n\nFor those in the back of the property, one had to drive to the rear and lug your bags\u002Fcoolers up the stairs, as the elevators were out of order due to construction.\n\nWe were in a newly renovated room.  I believe we were the very first to stay in it as we were taking plastic covers of electrical appliances (coffee, hair dryer) for use.  The decor is very nice and for once there is enough lighting in the room to dispel the cheesy lounge lighting level usually found in hotels.  We soon discovered that the AC unit did not work, so a repairman was dispatched within 5 minutes (good).  After 15 minutes of fiddling around, he said he would return with a new unit (OK).  The new unit was installed and he left but the room never seemed to cool off in comparison to the same room next door (bad).\n\nEvery ice machine in the hotel was out of service, meaning you had to trek way to the front restaurant to get ice.\n\nThe hallways, due to construction, were missing ceiling tiles and the carpets were covered in plastic to protect them from construction.  Hey hotel - if you are going to renovate, do the entire floor and close it to the public.\n\nWe paid $125\u002Fnight for the inconvenience of this hotel, when we could have got a better deal elsewhere.\n\nIt's tough to rate this hotel, but from my own experience with the seperation of the group, the AC issues and the lack of ice machines, I have to rate it low.

Therefore, it takes something truly exceptional for me to take the time and write a review.  My recent stay at Four Points Sheraton was EXCEPTIONAL in a very bad bad way.\n\nI checked in this past weekend (Dec 17th) at around 2pm and was given Room 117, which is an executive suite located on the ground floor.  I went in and checked the room out and apart from the bathtub enamel peeling around the drain (first time I've ever seen that), everything looked fine.  I did my bedbug check and found nothing, so I was happy with the room in terms of cleanliness.  I left for the day and spent time with family.  I arrived back at 8pm and there were kids everywhere running up and down the hall.  I thought\u2026no problem, I will just shut the door to the bedroom portion of my suite and it will be quiet.  WRONG\u2026I can hear constant running in the suite above us\u2026 BOOM BOOm Boom boom..boom Boom BOOm BOOM.  Back and forth, back and forth.  Stuff was constantly dropping, which happened until around 2:30am (Yes, I was up, even though I tried to sleep at 11pm).  I finally fell asleep at 3:30, only to be woken up to the same dropping and footsteps at 6:30am, at which time I got out of bed because I knew that 3 hours was all that I was going to get that night.  When left the room to check out, there were approx 20 kids in the hallway playing hockey.  I went back to snap a picture and most of them left but you can still see hockey being played (please see attached picture).  The icing on the cake was that multiple staff walked by and did nothing.  This is the first time that I've seen this in ANY hotel.  Hostel\u002FDorms, yes\u2026but not at a hotel.\n\nNow you are all probably wondering why I stayed in the room and not asked to be changed. First, my wife was not feeling well, so I didn't want to move her (she could sleep off and on).  Secondly, I went to the vending machine at around 1:30am and passed by a room that was extremely loud, lots of drunk people singing, beer cans in the hallway.  My reaction was\u2026at least I wasn't next to that!  Best of the worst\u2026in this poorly run hotel.\n\nNow for general thoughts about the hotel:  \n\nThe lobby is going through renovations, which you can walk through, and it is pretty nice for a four points.  A little dusty and dirty at the moment, so if you don't like staying in a construction site, stay away.\n\nThe beds are very bouncy, you will feel EVERY movement from your partner.  This is standard for every four points.  Even Sheraton Sweet Sleeper beds are like that, which I hate.  If you want better beds, you have to go all the way up to the Westin, the W Hotel, or St. Regis, which unfortunately London does not have.\n\nFree WIFI and bottle of water, which is great.  CLEAN brand products, which are ok. \n\nConclusion:  For approx. the same price, my suggestion would be to go downtown to the Delta or Hilton. I've stayed at the Delta many times in the past (one time for over a week) and never had a bad stay.  Much better then this pathetic excuse of a hotel.  For me, this stay was a total waste of $135.\n\nDisclaimer:  I have stayed in the hotel before, my last stay being 2 or 3 years ago.  I remember those stays, with the exception of one stay, being totally forgettable.  Being forgettable can be a good thing when it comes to hotels aiming for mediocrity.  The only reason I went back to this hotel in the past is due to the SPG program.  This time in particular, my SPG points were going to expire, so I needed a stay to 'reset' my points.

The public areas of the hotel are nicely appointed and the front desk staff were great. However, the first room we were given (a King Superior room) was in an older part of the hotel. Despite being nicely appointed and clean, the room had a distinctive damp, musty, mouldy smell that was extremely off-putting.

We tried to ignore the smell and dampness and hoped it would lessen, but it never did. \nWe should have complained right away, but we decided to just live with it. The next morning, however, we discovered that the shower was a pathetic trickle that made showering very difficult. We decided enough was enough and went to the front desk to seek a room change.

Good location, on the main road into town, large shopping center across the street, plenty of restaurants within walking distance.\n\nThe only negatives are that the air conditioner in the room is too loud, and that the breakfast buffet was not that good, especially for the price ($15.00!).

We are from Whitby and being lots of business London\u2019s way for the great hockey tournaments outside our loop. \n\nEvents are usually booked through a sport booking website. I\u2019ve never had a problem until this weekend.\n\nWe arrived at the hotel on Friday afternoon. Peter, the manager at the front desk signed us in. He said of course your room is ready for you as we expected you here last night. I said what? \n\nApparently we were automatically booked for 3 nights with the sport booking service, something I disregarded, knowing we would likely only need to the 2 nights. Assuming I was only booked for the 2 nights, I was displeased when Peter said you will have to take it up with the sport booking company. I emailed them right away and they said no, we just book it, the hotel charges you, just explained what happened. \n\nI went back to the front desk and Peter said I\u2019m sorry, we have to charge you for last night. It is our policy and we had to turn others away because we held your room. \n\nIf these rooms weren\u2019t expensive, I wouldn\u2019t care so much but we were paying $155 plus taxes. The almost $200 I needed to spend on the activities of the weekend. So this just threw me right off. I asked if he could charge half. He said no, this is our policy. I felt like saying, we just booked 17 rooms here for 2 nights. I\u2019ve never had this happen before and we won\u2019t bring the business back from Whitby for the future either. \n\nThen I talked to another mom who checked in later and she said the same happened to her! She was furious as well. She\u2019s a family of 5 and had to pay for another night on top of her 2 nights stay. \n\nNeedless to say, we refused to spend the money we would have spent at their restaurants, Sunday brunch etc because of this. None of the team members did. \n\nI am just so disappointed that such a great hotel quality wise would not have any empathy for us and turn a fun tournament weekend into an expensive stay. Disappointing to say the least. I would understand if this was something that had happened to us before, but I was genuinely in shock that I was booked for 3 nights knowing I\u2019m going to have to spend my food money to pay for another nights stay. \n\nWhitby teams are going to have to be warned to not use this hotel and any team booking ahead in the future needs to know when you\u2019ve made a mistake in your booking, you will pay for it. So frustrating....bummer weekend all around because of this.\n\nI think a place with excellent customer service would have some understanding.  If you can\u2019t give me a full refund, at least offer me brunch, a reduction, something!  \n\nMonique Kerr-Taylor",1,negative
data/ca/154995/182894/87817263.html,Four Points by Sheraton London,"""We stayed in this hotel for two nights with my son's hockey team.  There were at least four other hockey teams in the hotel.  I'm not sure why this hotel provides group rates for teams, because this hotel is the least team-friendly hotel I've ever stayed in. \n\nThe first night, after our children were curfewed to their room by the coaches, the parents were in the hallway and were advised by management that we had to move  into a room, which we did.  \n\nThere were quite a few people in our room, but we were not overly loud.  We were talking and laughing, no loud music, no destruction, in fact, two kids were sleeping in the adjoining room.  Without warning, the London Police knocked on our door, told us that all visitors in our room had to leave and return to their own room, and advised my husband that as the registered guest in that room, he and anybody else staying  in that  room had to pack their bags and leave the hotel, immediately.  \n\nWe are a professional couple, with two children who were sleeping in another room.  When I advised the police that we had been drinking, and had children sleeping in another room, we were advised that they would call us a cab, and that our children could stay with another family, but we were being evicted from the hotel.  Among the guests in our room were two police officers from other jurisdictions.  This was not a out of control, crazy destructive group of people.  These were parents having a few drinks, and a few laughs.  \n\nWe did not receive any warning from hotel management that there had been complaints, or that we were too loud, nor had we been asked to break up the gathering.  The London Police told us that according to management, we had been advised to break up the party, and had been warned and chose to ignore the warnings, so management had asked that we be evicted.  Luckily for us, one of the parents visiting in our room was able to talk the management into letting us stay, so long as all the visitors in our room immediately returned to their room.  \n\nThe next day, I had the opportunity to speak to the family that was in the room next to us.  Although they were with our group, they had not been involved in the socializing in my room.  She told me that she and her two sons were in their room, sleeping, heard no noise, and in fact, were not even aware that we had guests in our room.\n\nThe next night, I witnessed the same thing happen to another group.  I had walked by this room numerous times through the evening, and you could hear that they had music on and were laughing and talking, but unless you were walking right by their room, you could not hear anything, and they were definitely not disturbing anybody.  \n\nShortly after midnight, as I was returning to my room, I witnessed the London Police escorting this couple out of their room, to the front desk and supervised them leaving the hotel.  Again, there was no rowdiness, no destruction, no loud music, only a few parents having a few laughs and few drinks.\n\nMy son plays on a travel baseball and hockey team, and we have at least 5 to 6 out of town tournaments a year, for the last three years.    Never have a I stayed in a hotel that treated their guests in this manner.  I strongly feel that this particular night manager actually looked for situations that gave him an opportunity to \""weild his power\"", and actually enjoyed evicting families.\n\nThe room was clean, the check in staff and restaurant staff were helpful and friendly.  There was lots of parking.  The pool was large.  The hallways and stairways, had old tired carpetting.  Unfortunately, all of these things mean nothing, when you have the police knocking at your door to evict you, without warning.  \n\nI would not recommend staying at this hotel, particularly if you are with a large group.  I would think that even a wedding, with guests staying at this hotel, would have the same issue that I witnessed both nights I was a guest here.  If you are with a large group, that like to socialize, stay away from this hotel.  After I returned home, I found out that one of my family  members stayed at this hotel 3 years ago and had the same issue with this same night manager.  This would lead me to believe that this happens every weekend.  Not a good experience.",1,negative

It is an ok place to rest your head, if you're used to budget accommodations and no frills.\n\nPROS: Good location.  I had booked a non-smoking Queen room but was apparently upgraded to a large 2-bed suite when i arrived, for the same low price.  Perhaps because I mentioned I'd read they had cool murals when I arrived late that evening.  The room walls were painted with an outdoor Italian villa mural (the ceiling was, of course, clouds and sky) and the unit included a mini-fridge AND a microwave!  The bathroom had clearly been remodeled recently with new ceramics and tub, and the entire room was in pretty good condition and clean. The toilet bowl had damage from someone scrubbing too hard with a metal wire brush, but was clean.  I found the beds a bit lumpy.  The air conditioning\u002Ffan unit was very loud even on the low setting but worked well. All bulbs were of the fluorescent energy-efficient variety which was good to see.  Check out was 11am which allows you some time to sleep in.  The other rooms on the sides of the \""U\"" appeared to be much smaller than the suites at the back.\n\nCONS: A group of male guests was talking and continually loitering outside the adjoining room at the edge of the parking lot for a long time late at night, which is not good when there are other guests arriving (especially single women traveling alone who need to get past people like this) and the sound of people talking outside rooms carries into other people's rooms. Management needs to post No Loitering signs or something.  We were going to complain about it to management to get the people to move along, but then a thunderstorm conveniently arrived which dispersed them.  Paper-thin walls means you should bring earplugs if you don' t want to be disturbed by other guests talking, or their TVs, in adjoining rooms.  Though the windows in my room were newer and upgraded, the frame of one of the windows in my room seemed to be broken\u002Fdamaged. There was a boot mark scuff on my room door which, one would surmise, means someone tried to kick in the door at some point in the past.\n\nAll in all the hotel was what one would expect for budget accommodations and I found it was fairly well kept.

Located on the east side of London, close to the airport, it was not a bad area of town, and being right on Dundas it was easy to get wherever we needed to go.  There were several nice restaurants close as well as stores for shopping.  In selecting this hotel we had read all of the Tripadvisor  reviews and were impressed that the owner cared enough to read and reply to many of the comments.  We are planning a return trip to the area and will definately consider another stay at this hotel.",4,positive

Nothing special but ok and did I mention the whole deal was *CHEAP*?\n\nThe Bad: \n- Wall & frame around door is dirty and needs to be wiped down; corners everywhere in the room seemed to be where the grime has been allowed to collect for millennia; \n- Bed was older and saggy. I slept ok, but I could sleep on a battlefield, so don't go by me. \n- The TV takes 2 remotes; one to turn TV on\u002Foff, the other to change channels, so make sure both are on the bedside table.  I figured this out after I was snug in bed and wanted to turn the TV off....and couldn't. Dang...! That meant getting back up. \n- Room was very small, as was the bathroom, but really, no biggie unless you or your loved one is the size of a grand piano. \n- Forget about Netflix on your laptop, the internet worked but not super fast.  Ok for surfing or chatting on facebook messenger, for instance, but nothing that requires plenty of bandwidth. \n\nThe Ugly: Small hole in ceiling where ceiling meets wall, to the left of bed that just kinda struck me as an entry way for pesky demon-like bugs probably hiding in the ceiling waiting to feast on....well... me! Take your pick as to the variety, I hate them all. Pollyfil, caulking, silicone...ANYTHING!!! needs to be applied to that small hole just for peace of mind.  I need to point out that I never saw a single bug but that obvious entry way freaked me out.  \n\nSo, would I stay here again?  Probably not. I ended up spending 2 nights in London, but only the first night here.  If price is your only concern tho, this place will do. \nSweet dreams...",2,negative

We got a room at the Best Western Stoneridge Inn & Confrence Centre.  Our stay was good for a three star hotel.  The room was comfortable with a king size bed and we were graciously given late checkout (we didn\u2019t arrive until almost midnight and were exhausted from packing and loading everything we own into the Uhaul).  The lady at the front desk was very nice and even wished us a good night when we were on our way back in from my partner smoking medical marijuana in the freezing cold parking lot at 1AM.  Our only complaint during the stay was that the included breakfast was not good \u2013 the eggs appeared to be some sort of previously frozen egg patties I\u2019d never seen before.  All in all the hotel was exactly what we were looking for for the night, unfortunately that is not the end of the experience.\n\n3-4 days after our stay, I found a charge for $250 on my credit card (Hotwire rooms are prepaid through Hotwire so there should not have been any charges by the hotel to my card).  Sure an error was made, I called the hotel to have it corrected.  I was told the charge was for smoking in the room.  I was not contacted prior to my card being charged.  I then spoke with the manager, Natalie Zima.  I explained that we absolutely did not smoke in the room and that neither I, nor my partner smoke cigarettes.  She responded that it wasn\u2019t cigarettes (in a \u2018got ya\u2019 tone of voice) and proceeded to make snide comments about smoking pot throughout the remainder of the conversation.  She claimed that she had to put both our room and a neighbouring room out of service while they and the hallway were all deep cleaned.  She also claimed she smelled the strong smell when she dropped off a box of tissue in the morning around 11AM before we checked out (why didn\u2019t she inform us of the charge she intended to put through then?? And why weren\u2019t we informed at checkout 3 hours later of the charge??).  The call ended with her repeatedly and rudely refusing to reverse the charge and then abruptly hanging up on me.  The total call time was no more than 3 minutes. \n\nShe also claimed she was the sole owner of the hotel when I asked to speak to her superior(s).  I later discovered this was not true.\n\nThe charge was clearly put through after we left so we would have no opportunity to discuss it \u2013 why else would she choose not to inform us while we were still there?  The front desk lady saw us go outside the evening before \u2013 why else would people go out to the parking lot for 10-15 minutes in the middle of the night, except to smoke OUTSIDE the hotel??  The manager clearly has a big problem with marijuana and used her position of authority (and ridiculous ability to put a large charge through on my credit card without my authorization) to punish\u002Fattack\u002Fdiscriminate against us because my partner needs to smoke marijuana for medical reasons.  Third hand smoke on our clothing cannot possibly create the smell she claims existed, especially not the next morning.  In fact, we crossed the US border 2 hours after leaving the hotel \u2013 had we smelled of marijuana as we would have had to for the room and adjoining room and hallway to smell as much as was claimed, we surely would have had serious problems crossing with a fully packed 20 foot Uhaul.  They opened the back, looked in, and closed it.  \n\nI am a lawyer licenced in Ontario and am currently waiting for the 8-12 week dispute process through my credit card company to run its course.  My credit card company thinks the charge will ultimately be reversed.   If it is not, I feel so strongly about the way we were treated and that we were essentially stolen from, that I will be pursuing this matter until it is fairly resolved despite the fact it would usually be too low an amount to sue for.  One of the benefits of being a lawyer is that my legal fees will be zero.\n\nWhatever you do, DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL.

The foyer was impressive and spacious, which gave me a good feeling about the room, all of which are on the main floor (for standard), so no struggling with bags up any stairs.\n\nThe room was really comfy and the mattress amazing, I got a really nice sleep. However, there were small stains on the headboard, which I wiped with a damp hand towel. I also noticed very thick dust gathered around the bottom of the lamp shade, which I'm surprised housekeeping did not notice. I'm very sensitive to dust, so not a great situation.\n\nThe bathroom didn't appear to have been cleaned. The floor was dirty (shoe\u002Fdirt marks everywhere), the edge of the bathtub had stains from the previous guest, there was soap scum on the shower shelving, and toothpaste stains etc on the sink countertop as well as the sink faucet. The toilet was clean but everything else appeared to have been forgotten by housekeeping. I had to clean with a damp hand towel and used a bath towel to cover the stains on the floor.\n\nThe following morning (fortunately I had already woken up) I heard sounds coming from the door handle and noticed through the spy hole that it was housekeeping trying to get in my room. No knock or anything, just lots of fidgeting around with the door handle\u002Flock. She left and then I noticed she returned a few minutes later doing the same thing briefly, then disappeared. Then about 20 mins later a guest attempted to open my door with his key card, but I caught him in time and opened the door myself, to which he apologized. It appeared that reception did not let housekeeping know that I was in the room, so the room was showing up as vacant to them. I've worked in hotels in the past and know that the receptionist must have printed off the housekeeping and emergency guest list sheets before my reservation had been made that evening, but they should have known to manually add me to those lists if they were not willing to do a new printout. The really dangerous thing about it is if there was a fire or a computer blackout, no one would have known I was in the room, since I was not on those lists. Though this was probably a one-off occurrence, I hope management still look into this as this is a safety issue and should not happen again.\n\nI would recommend this hotel, it was comfortable, I had a great sleep, but housekeeping need to be more thorough with their cleaning. They should clean the rooms as if they plan on staying in them. If it's not clean for them, then it's not clean for their guests.",3,negative

Steve on the front desk pulled up our reservation, said \""We've got you on the second floor, that's not going to work for you\"" and then explained that, having noticed my walking with a cane, the second floor would not be appropriate as there is not yet an elevator (though I understand one is on the way). He got us a room on the main floor and, thankfully, near the lobby end of the hall so no long treks just to get to the room.  The room itself was clean and comfortable, the wifi hookup was excellent and the on site restaurant, Pestos, was wonderful - in fact we ate there every night we were in town as it was blustery outside and the food was great and we didn't have to worry about driving back if we had a glass of wine with our meals. I was concerned that it might be noisy as it's very near the 401 but never heard the traffic when in the room and didn't hear the wedding reception and guests on the Saturday night, either. Very quiet. It's convenient to everything in London, without having to fight the traffic all the time. It's about a 15 to 20 minute drive to the University of Western Ontario or downtown and the airport, especially at 5am, is a 20 to 30 minute drive (and the 30 minute drive was at the tail end of rush hour). The staff was consistently helpful and we really enjoyed our stay. We'll stay again when we go down this summer to pick up our trailer.

For our most recent visit we decided to explore the Stoneridge Inn which offered a number of advantages... easy on-off access to the 401, a very reasonable rate, and an almost traffic-free direct route from the hotel to our west-end family members.  \n\nAs noted in other reviews, there is an elevator under construction but not yet in operation, so we reserved a ground level room for just a couple of dollars extra. The room was comfortable, clean, pleasantly decorated and sufficiently spacious.  Clean bathroom with a good hair drier and good shower pressure. (One note... the shower\u002Fbath enclosure had a ceiling which would be high enough for most guests, but might be a tad claustrophobic for individuals 6 \u00BD feet or taller.)  Excellent bed. We slept well with absolutely no noise problems. \n\nWhen we arrived the reception area warmly inviting with a lit fireplace going and the reception staff friendly and efficient. Buffet breakfast from 6:30 am \u2013 9:00 am is included in the rate; choices include standard scrambled eggs & sausages, toast, bagels, muffins, fresh fruit, yogurt, pastries and assorted cereals, similar to many other hotels... but is served in an upscale ambiance in the on-site Pasto's Grill. The attending server was very friendly and provided a choice of juices and really good coffee. We lingered over our coffees well past 9:00 am, and unlike our experience at a number of other hotels, the server gave absolutely no indication that we might consider moving on. In fact as we finally left she offered us cups of coffee to go with a warm, friendly smile and wished us Merry Christmas.\n\nSeparate note: We ate at Pasto's Grill the evening before and thoroughly enjoyed the meal... ref separate restaurant review.  Pasto's Grill is well worth experiencing regardless of where one stays in London. \n\nBottom line: Very Good combination of location (for us), value, room, facilities and staff.

Arriving late at night, in what seemed to be the middle of nowhere, I admit to being apprehensive - however, the minute I walked through the lobby doors, friendly desk staff, a beautiful fireplace and comfy chairs provided a great first impression.\n\nMy room was on the second floor - an elevator would have been nice to make it easier to get luggage to my room - so if you have any issues with that - just request a ground floor room.\n\nThe room, with a king size bed, appeared to be recently updated, with nice decor and was set up for a business guest, with a desk and an ergonomic chair.  The entertainment unit doubled as a dresser, and contained a bar fridge, microwave and in-room coffee maker.  The old heating\u002FAC unit and the gray(!!??) toilet, tub and tub surround were the only items that indicated that the room had indeed been updated.  The heater worked well - but being an older unit, it was either on or off - no opportunity to have \""white noise\"" to combat the highway traffic (i.e. most newer hotels I've stayed in - the fan runs constantly, with the heat or AC kicking on when needed - so great \""white noise\"" opportunity!) - unless you left the fan on - which I ended up doing - so it worked out - but if it had been colder, it would have made the room too cold!\n\nWhen I finally climbed into bed - I was blown away! Not only was the bed amazingly comfortable (a medium firm, pillow top mattress) - but the sheets were silky soft!  No scratchy, bleachy-smelling sheets here!  Just nice, smooth sheets with a nice warm duvet and 4 pillows!\n\nI also believe that this was the cleanest hotel room I've ever stayed in! It was absolutely immaculate! Even the dated toilet and tub were immaculate.\n\nIf you are in the area, definitely stay here!!",5,positive

I'm sure it is for safety reasons but leaning over the counter to blow dry my hair wasn't a lot of fun. I thankfully had an extension cord in my luggage and so it all worked out.  Maybe there is a plug in outside of the dangers of the sink\u002Fbathroom that would have worked, I didn't have time to look.  So it all worked out.\n\nThe staff were great.

We usually stay in hotels priced around $79-$120\u002Fnight, but since we were there for a wedding and wanted to avoided driving back in to London (about a 10 minute drive) so we decided to splurge for the higher price room. The higher price room perhaps came with a higher expectation that unfortunately it couldn't meet. \n\nThe front desk staff weren't particularly friendly, but helpful. The room itself is on the smaller side but the temperature was just right and the bed and pillows were comfortable. The bathroom was also on the smaller side which made it difficult for both or us to get ready for the wedding at the same time. There was no other mirror besides the one of the back of the bathroom door. The shower is very small. The actually shower head was place no higher than my height (I'm 5'5\""). Like mentioned in previous reviews, we had to shower hunched over. Although, the shampoo and conditioner were nice. \n\nMoving ahead, the wedding we attended was a cash bar. But the hotel or restaurant had no ATM and this was a problem for many of the guests. My boyfriend had to run out to grab some cash, missing a portion of the wedding.\n\nWe probably wouldn't choose this hotel over others in the future, especially for the price.",3,negative

Knowing that now, we still decided to stay there on this visit since it is a very nice place to stay. \n\nLooking at a map and considering other options, it prevailed that the destination we planned to visit three times during our stay (London Hunt and Golf Club) was just as accessible from this hotel as from the alternatives. Knowing this, its isolation from the hubbub of the city was more of an asset than a detriment. \n\nThe service at the front desk remains stellar and the amenities in our room are Best Western standard, meaning very good. Breakfast in the adjoining restaurant was good with above average options in my opinion. We were late in arriving one evening due to a Garmin malfunction during which we lost our appetites. We did enjoy a light meal of soup and appetizers in the restaurant. It is deemed to be among the best in London.\n\nThere are a variety of snacks, drinks and other amenities at the front desk, an obvious acknowledgment by management that one can't just walk down the street to get something they might require of that sort.\n\nShould we ever return to London for a third time, this is where we'd stay!",5,positive

The wifi connects easily, and there is a good selection of channels to choose from if you wish to watch TV. There is also a nice little gym room which is fantastic! \nHowever, this hotel is in the middle of NOWHERE. There is nothing in walking or driving distance if you want to explore...it is literally in the middle of nowhere. \nThis hotel is so cold that you need to wear a sweater and sweat pants...and we went in AUGUST. We thought that perhaps it was just the lobby that was cold, but once we got upstairs to our room, not only were we greeted with an arctic breeze, but rather a rancid humid smell in the room. I can't explain to you how God awful the smell in the room was... if I could sum it up, it smelled like smelly, wet, socks, and wet dog. We thought that maybe it was just our room, but when we went to another family member's room, it was the exact same thing, and yes, they smelled it too. Aside from the foul smell, and the arctic temperature, the rooms are ridiculously small. The bathroom is literally the size of a closet. There was no soap in the bathroom, and barely enough towels or toilet paper. So, if you do decide to stay at this hotel, be certain that you have a room to yourself. \nThe breakfast was another huge disappointment. The eggs were runny, soggy and tasteless. The waffles were ok, the potatoes were okay too. It was all very plain-jane. Not only that, but everyone that ate the breakfast began to have stomach issues soon after eating. \nHonestly, I wouldn't recommend staying here.",2,negative

I wish the Front Desk had given us information about the restaurant when we booked in.  My husband was wearing a sports sweater and a baseball cap and because of entering off the hotel side, we had to walk through this very-full, fancy restaurant to get to the Hostess.  We felt very underdressed!!  Additionally, the menu was not cheap - except the pizzas, those were an okay value (I believe the cheapest was $15 for a quite large thin crust pizza).  The pizza was delicious and the service was fast.  Just when you go to a hotel restaurant, traditionally it is not a fancy\u002Fpricey restaurant.

That's Ok we are healthy enough to do it ourselves. On our way to our room we passed a conference room, as this hotel is  used for weddings, meetings and conferences. There were tables set up outside of the conference rooms with tablecloths, food, cutlery and drinks\u002Fice. My husband and I passed by those tables all weekend and they were not cleaned up until Sunday morning. The tables remained. The food was finally cleared, not to mention crumbs etc...This did not impress me. It really turned me off as we had to pass by these tables every time we left our rooms to go into london. We figured they were short staffed? Anyway, I decided to try the fitness room and entered it with a shock. It smelled like sewer in the room. The room was very tiny warm and smelly. I proceeded to work out on very rocky and cheap treadmill but it did not work - broken. The eliptical was functional but the time\u002Fdistance\u002Fcalorie part of it was broken. Same with the stationary bike. It was obvious that the fitness room was run down and not maintained. There was a water jug in there with paper cups. I drank some water from it and it was stale and the cups smelled old.\n\nOne more area of concern: the washroom. Yes, very clean but the counter top and toilet is extremely low to the ground and I am only 5'5\"". My husband is 6'1\""and we were hunched over all weekend using the sink. It was very uncomfortable. Furthemore, the water coming from the taps and shower smelled like sewer. It was very annoying because then my hair would smell like it as well, no matter how much I washed it with shampoo. I smelled like sewer all weekend.\n\nThe beds are  nice and large but very hard. \n\nThe breakfast that was free was satisfactory. Great coffee, but you have to ask for it and they serve it to you.

The breakfast was all starchy sweets, bagles, cereal, french toast strips and sausage. The sausage was tasty. I got the last omlette in the heated container but for the rest of the weekend they did not make any more omlettes...too bad because they were good.\n\nBottom line: This hotel is inconsistent in what they offer and how they care for the place. It needs greater attention to detail and service. We will not be returning to this place.",3,negative

My husband and I checked in mid afternoon to be advised of a huge power outage in a portion of the city which was of no fault of the hotel.  I dealt with Holly upon our arrival and it was obvious that she was in total control of a stressful situation dealing with other guests in almost total darkness.  She handled herself very well under the circumstances dealing with phone calls, the internet which was almost non existant as well as waiting guests.  We were offered to go to the other Best Western if we wanted, however with our past experience we were all very happy with this hotel and wanted to stay after being told the lights would come back on at 11pm.  As a result, the Pasto's Grill was closing as it was unsafe for the staff cooking for the few customers they had in mid afternoon.  So once the rest of the family arrived, we decided to order in pizza's from a local establishment on the recommendation of Holly and we were glad that we did.  Our room faced the back and yes, the power did come back on at 11pm and all was back to normal.  The room was very quiet and we actually had the best sleep ever even being so close to the 401 hwy but could not hear it at all.   The staff on our check out was extremely friendly and helpful.  I dealt with Nikki, Jacquie and Natalie,...the owner as well as 2 managers and they were all so very helpful, professional and took the time to discuss the events of the previous evening and to make sure that our stay was comfortable.  I love the personal touch we get here,..they are all amazing.   In the morning we are offered the buffet which comes with our room.  It was lovely, very fresh and tasty.  Our server was Tracy who was very kind and helped us with everything we needed.  They offered an array of hot items which were plain scrambled eggs as well as a Mexican type scrambled eggs with pieces of peppers and tomato in it,.which was really good.  They also had hashbrown patties and cooked slices of sausage along with mini flavoured pancake pieces,...  Along with this, there were many other items like fresh fruit compote, yogourt, breads, tea and coffee to name a few.  All in all it was a terrific breakfast.  Our stay here was great, and we will do it again and sooner if possible. Thanks everyone for a very comfortable stay, friendly and professional.",5,positive

Not a ton of space between the 2nd bed and the desk. Mattresses are firm - I like that so it was good for me, but some may not enjoy it so much. Everything fairly clean. Would prefer full size pillows to the smaller ones they use. Good sized refrigerator and microwave included in the room, and I liked the fact I could walk out to my car through the sliding doors.\n\nWiFi was fast.

Eggs, sausage\u002Fbacon, waffles, breads, cereals, juices, etc. All were fully stocked and tasty. \n\nOne thing is that the walls are paper thin - you can hear clear conversations going on in the room next to you, which may be a privacy issue as well as disruptive late at night\u002Fearly in the morning.

At 11am, I received a knock on the door from staff telling me it was checkout time. I found this bizarre - I was in the shower at the time, and the staff member left before I could get to the door, but he then called my room to tell me the same. I told him I had late checkout, and he said all was fine... still thought it was strange.\n\nOverall, it's an older hotel with friendly staff (albeit a bit disorganized not to log my late checkout), very convenient location as there are many restaurants and White Oaks mall within walking distance, so you have to temper expectations.

When we checked out I informed the front desk clerk who advised that they were aware there was an issue with the plumbing and that a plumber had been called.  She initially offered to provide us with a discount on the bill...until she noted that we were not charged for our adult daughter staying with us....which when we were given the discount we were led to believe that it was a perk for Western students!!!  Needless to say, for $140\u002Fnight, I was not impressed and probably will not be back to stay here.  We previously have stayed at the Lamplighter while in London and will most likely return to staying there as we always know we will be satisfied.  Too bad because the Windemere seemed to be a great alternative.",2,negative

I have always hesitated to review the hotel because it is a bit tired and I don't want to hold that against the place, which in itself is a big compliment.  The buildings, once a grand estate, are still beautiful, but a bit worn.  The interior of the building is dated but clean and has everything you need.  The staff is very nice.   The bottom line is this.  It is a unique hotel that could use some updating, but it is still a very good place to stay.  They also have simply amazing deals combining great dinners, movie passes, spa treatments, etc. with the cost of your room, usually around $129 or $139 all in.  You can't beat that.

The Windermere Chef has my 'kudos' - excellent meal.    My waiter, Mike, deserved the 20% tip I left; he was a polite young man and looked to my every need with grace.

My waitress corrected me, \""You mean Sambucca\"" so I smiled and said \""very well -- or Pernod or one of those.\"" I was told by the waitress that there was none of these.  I asked if there were any other choices of digestif that one could sip with an espresso.  \""No\"" was the short answer before she walked away.  I queried the Bar Manager; she said, \""Sorry, we don't allow \""SHOOTERS\"" to be served in the dining room.\""  I was abashed.  I asked her if she was aware that a digestif along with an espresso is customary, hence the reason that licorice based digestifs were usually served with a coffee bean?

Basically it gets you a room with dinner for two and a hot breakfast buffet thrown in. The hotel itself is a quaint old mansion set on beautiful grounds. It's a little confusing to get into, so you have to watch the signs carefully. Also, watch out for deer, as there are some that roam the property. The hallways, rooms and fixtures are getting a little tired, and will probably need updating before too long. We couldn't get a basic room and ended up with a suite for $20 extra. The beds were quite comfortable, and there was a handy little kitchenette in the livingroom area. Again, the appliances were somewhat dated and the bathroom tiles, sink and tap fixtures were fairly old looking. The rooms still use door keys, instead of cardlocks.\nThe real upside to this was the dining experience. The 3 course dinner that came with the Fall-cation special was excellent. There are basically two choices of appetizers, entrees (chicken or steak) and desserts. The meals even come with a 1\u002F2 pint of their own micro-brewed (and very good) beer. The next morning, we had the hot breakfast buffet, which was also quite good.

First contact at the hotel was a very disinterested man, no hello how are you, no eye contact, in fact probably the worst hotel reception I have encountered in many years.\nThe room was cleanish, a bit tired looking, carpet 1990's but it didn't matter as the room was just for sleeping the family event was the main thing.\n5pm the festivities began and things couldn't have been any more different. The serving staff were all smiles and helpful with the kids (about 10 children ranging from 6 months to 10 years), the bar staff were really polite, friendly and chatty. The meal was very good, well cooked, hot :-) and on time.\nThat night it rained a great deal and our room was up by the roof. The down spout was very nosy with a loud dripping noise which kept our son awake until midnight. My wife contacted Reception and they didn't really want to know or care what the issue was. They didn't even come up to the room to check the noise level out themselves! so nothing happened at all!!\nWe all left the next day after a breakfast and again the Reception staff were grumpy, unhelpful, disengaged. We brought up the issue of the noise the night before and they were still very unhelpful. Took the shine off the event to be honest.",2,negative

Coming from a big city (Toronto), we chose the Windermere because it seemed to be scenic, quaint and therefore the perfect hotel for a weekend getaway\u002Fmini-vacation.\n\nPros: Hotel was quiet as expected, it was nice to go back to a calm atmosphere after a wild and rambunctious engagement party! The room was spotless and the beds were very comfortable, I personally had an excellent sleep. The room was also quite large. The hotel and the grounds were very charming and elegent with a lovely old-age, Victorian feel. Very relaxing stay!\n\nCONS: The lady at the front desk (should have caught her name) was incredibly rude. Immediately was judgmental towards my friends and I because we were younger than the majority of the hotel guests. Warned us against making noise and that only a maximum of two people were allowed in the room. We assured her that we would not be breaking any of the \""hotel policies. However, she still maintained an attitude toward us through the remainder of the trip! It was quite offensive as we were paying customers as well and should have been treated with the same quality of respect as the other hotel guests!!!",4,positive

Danielle was nothing short of amazing throughout my entire experience with her from the very beginning. I cant even begin to imagine how busy she must be with all the brides she works with, but I never felt ignored and I never felt that she was too busy to help me. She was very prompt with all her emails and got back to me pretty fast even during the BUSY wedding season when she was busier with other brides with upcoming weddings. Danielle was so easy going and so personable and she made us ALL feel comfortable when our families and wedding party came for the rehearsal the day before our wedding. She has a sense of humour which is so important and she made us all feel relaxed and right at home. \n\nThe day of our wedding I somehow managed to stay extremely calm throughout the entire day and I think Danielle is to thank for that :) Every bride I spoke to before my wedding always said to me \""don't worry, things will go wrong and there is nothing you can do about it\"" but honestly, our day was FLAWLESS. I cannot complain about one single thing! It was relaxed and beautiful and everyone had a perfect day including me!\n\nThe food was absolutely amazing! I want to thank the kitchen staff for providing our guests and ourselves with such a beautiful meal! The waiting staff were so attentive and so kind and always made sure that we were okay and we had wine, etc. Dinner was quick and easy and we did not have to sit and wait for our food! I literally cannot say enough good things!\n\nAs for the hotel- the rooms are clean (coming from someone with OCD) and extremely comfortable. It's weird because I have anxiety that unfortunately causes me to HATE staying anywhere other than home, but I felt very comfortable here and OMG were the beds ever comfortable!!!\n\nLike I said- we continue to get compliments about every aspect of our wedding and it honestly brings me so much joy that our guests enjoyed our day as much as we did.

But it's not particularly new, and a little rough around the edges. Some will undoubtedly argue that it has \""charm\"" and while I would not necessarily disagree, I'm not a fan of hotels that presume to substitute charm for amenities or execution. My room was fine, the bed a bit too soft, noticeably softer on the left side than the right (time for a mattress update, I think). The carpet had a burn mark from a iron seared into it, which mattered not at all from a practical standpoint, but was definitely noticeable. Temperature control in the room, which can be a problem in hotels during the winter (when I was at Windermere) was just fine. Housekeeping a uneven (sometimes they would tidy up my ice bucket, sometimes they did not - again, not a big deal, but uneven). There were not enough outlets in the room, so I had to unplug the desk lamp (and work in the dark) to plug in my computer, and I had to move the coffee maker into the bathroom (no place to plug it in otherwise). Breakfast was just okay. You get coupons to use for a breakfast of oatmeal and toast, some fruit (not a great selection). For $5 more, you can order a hot breakfast, some eggs, and you have some coupons for hot breakfast; confusingly, though, those coupons are not for the $5 hot breakfast, they're only for Saturdays when there's a hot buffet also. And Sunday you also need a special coupon, good only until 9:30. Overall, I found it confusing, and a Hampton Inn has a better breakfast, though I did enjoy the honey they produce on the premises.

It is nice and quiet, tucked into a park like setting. One could hear the frogs singing outside the windows in the evening. Very pleasant indeed. The hotel is clean and comfortable with pleasant staff. This facility however is very dated, looking like it is still 1975 instead of 2018. It needs a serious renovation if it wants to continue to serve as a mid-scale boutique hotel. One can only imagine what marvelous changes  Bryan and Sarah Baeumler could make to enhance this unique facility. The included breakfast was a disappointment. It consisted only of coffee, plain bagels, muffins some cut up pieces of fruit and cereal as choices. If you wanted a proper cooked breakfast, then that could be had for an additional charge based on what was ordered. However, the breakfast room which appears to have been recently renovated opened at 7 a.m. and we had to be at an appointment for 8:15 a.m. None of the kitchen equipment was even turned on, so there was no chance of getting a cooked breakfast and being at our destination on time. There was an attendant, but he did not seem very friendly. When we said good morning to him, his response was to simply clear his throat. He only spoke to people as they left with a simple \""good morning\"". When one considers  the breakfasts we have had included at other local London hotels or B&B's for a booking rate that was considerably lower, then the Windermere is definitely lagging in this respect and it is very disappointing.",3,negative

From the outside, you would expect that this is an expensive, high end hotel that offers endearing features from the past.  I was very under whelmed.\n\nThe front desk is tiny and I felt cluttered with unappealing items for sale.  They still use the old method of an actual key to unlock the room doors.  At first, when you walk into the room (we stayed in room 110), you begin to see why it is NOT a high end hotel.  The bathroom is minimal in appearance.  The colour is drab and lacks any type of appeal.  The bedroom itself is spacious but the furniture is basic and I consider outdated.  There was a power bar that had 4 (four) different appliances plugged into it, yet to find a plug to plug in our media devices was awkward.  I had to unplug the desk lamp, stretch it across the front of the television and plug it into the power bar.\n\nThe bed is amazingly comfortable, and why I gave this place a 3\u002F5.

The Manor was recommended by the  family as the best place to stay .  Found out afterward that they had never been there and went on recommendation of friends.  Arrived Friday around 6 p.m to find that they had made mistake with our reservation (which was booked 6 months prior).They put us in the basement and said we would be moved sometime the next day but were unsure of when. Could not promise it would be before we had to dress for the wedding.  The front desk  male attendant was not the least bit helpful. He said if we needed extra sheets to make up the sofa bed for our grandchildren to call and he would bring some down.   Our basement suite was so musty I refused to hang our things in the closet.  The suite had a terrible smell and there was no ventilation.  We had to attend a function so looking for another hotel was out of the question.  I called  for sheets as the sofabed had not been  made up even though I had requested this when I made the reservation. After quite a while the front desk person arrived and literally threw some sheets at me and said I could make the sofa up........they don't offer that service.,After a very restless night with little sleep my husband went very early in the morning to see when we would be moved.  They gave us a new suite on the first floor.  I literally ran to get there.  It was not any better than the basement other than the fact we had an above ground window.  My cousin was in a suite at the other end of the manor on the first level and his suite was lovely.  Both our suites were in dire need of update and a thorough cleaning. Had two meals in the restaurant and both were rather low quality.  This area also could use a very good scrubbing.  The complimentary breakfast was meager at best.  All in all probably the worst  place we have ever stayed in and we travel a fair bit.  We were offered ten dollars off the first night rate for our inconvenience.  I found that almost insulting!!!!!!",1,negative

The fact that I was due to undergo surgery the following day was already stressful enough so being helped smartly and efficiently by Windermere staff was a great bonus.  I encourage any and all to enjoy this grand property for a good value stay.  The quirks of an old property can be charming but with vigilance and maintenance there is a lot of life left in her.

The rooms are clean and the beds are very comfortable and laundry machines are available for use free of charge.\nSince I was lucky enough when I called to get the manager, once I explained the reason for our visit, we were given a suite on the first floor at a discounted rate and treated fabulously! Gwen and her staff were professional, understanding and very obliging! Since I was given an LOA from the hospital, they even provided us with Christmas dinner, brought to our room, with all the fixings from a long planned, sold out dinner that the hotel puts off. I was so impressed that I cried. Breakfast was included every morning in the cafe. You could not get any better hospitality or service at a big, fancy chain hotel no matter how hard you tried! The location is just lovely, being so close to the hospital (a $5 cab fare), as well as a short (minutes) drive from every other part of town, but still being tucked back in the \""woods\"" where we enjoyed seeing wild turkeys roaming, and deer grazing on the grounds....you couldn't ask for any better place to be while going through illness and recovery.

The Manor is conveniently located to UWO and the University Hospital. It is quite remote from the downtown core and everything else ($19 cab ride from the train station). I was told that there is a large mall a $10 cab ride away. So the location's convenience entirely depends on the purpose for your visit.\n\nThe grounds were absolutely lovely. This is an old historic building which is surrounded by lots of beautiful trees displaying gorgeous fall colours, this time of the year. I got a suite (#301) and it was basically a 1-bedroom apartment. The carpets were stained and in dire need for a change but everything else seemed quite clean (I checked). The bed was comfortable (Simmons Beautyrest mattress). There is a shower, but no bathtub which did not matter to me but may to others. An ironing board is provided, which is nice. There are no slippers or robes, so bring your own. There is a kitchenette in the room with a sink, bar fridge and microwave. There is nothing inside the bar fridge and no convenience stores that I could find nearby to fill it (These may be non-issues for people coming here by car). The temperature control in the room was great and highly responsive. The room was on a corner and very quiet. I had a lovely view on the woods. The extra money for the suite was well worth it, even though I was a solo traveller. \n\nThe breakfasts were more simple and modest than what I have grown accustomed to on my travels (hot breakfast does not include menu items but buffet items such as eggs, sausages, bacon, home fries). The bread was grocery store bagels and toast, as well as what looked like Pillsbury mini croissants. There was yogourt, as well. There were no cheeses I could see. Not much variety, overall. Having said that, the breakfast is included in the price of the room and that is no longer the norm in Canada so perhaps one cannot be too critical. Another guest commented that the menu item she ordered for an additional fee took \""forever\"" to be served so give yourself plenty of time if you want a frittata, an omelette or pancakes.   \n\nThe conference centre facilities were very good. The catering was reasonable although some savoury dishes had a tendency to be too sweet (The pulled roast chicken definitely fit that category).     \n\nI would not hesitate to stay there again if I were attending a conference which was being held there.",3,negative

I asked to see the room as I was apprehensive about the place. He gave me the key to the room and I followed a long, dark, not very clean hallway to the very end.

Lock mechanisms missing from doors leading into hallway, and windows leaking so bad, that the entire side of the room was covered by an inch of water. Staff were called into the area to turn on the lights, and couldn't understand parents concerns with poor lighting, just shrugged shoulders and left. Each room has a detailed towel inventory, and price list for missing towels, so you are required to get towels from the front desk before going to the pool. My daughter was handed a towel that should have been torn up for rags years ago. When I complained about the 'holey towel', I got the same shrug and dismissal.\n The people next door complained about the heat not working, and the maintenance guy couldn't fix it (it was also mislabelled).

We were told to park at a side door for closer access to our room, the parking lot had not been cleared very well as we got stuck in the snow and required hydro workers to come and push us out.

At best, it's a tired 2 star motel sorely in need of a complete gutting and refit, or tearing down and replacing with a modern hotel like the ones across and down the street. \n\nAlthough reasonably well appointed (for 1980), at least on the first floor (I've read horror stories about units on the second floor), my nose was accosted by a horrible odor in the hallway, and a stuffy and somewhat sour-smelling room, albeit with a comfortable bed. This outweighs the nice welcome at the front desk. The whole place needs a thousand gallons of Febreze sprayed everywhere.\n\nInternet: speed tests showed downloads only 3x 1995's AOL dial-up speeds. Barely half a MB per second download, and half that up, and that is with a full-strength wireless connection. Useless for anything other than Internet browsing and email.

The large indoor pool is always heated warm, a nice perk.\n\n-Darryl, the manager is like one friendly teddy bear, always smiling, allowing us in certain circumstances to check out late (if we needed to visit my dad at the hospital), always making us feel that our occasional requests are doable, and his focus is always on us; how he can improve our stay, lessen our general worries, and help us get a great nights rest. We truly appreciate this, and have not forgotten your generosity \u2665\n\n-Mike, Jeff & Joan are three of the staff at the front desk\u002Freception that know my family\u2019s names off by heart, they are always greeting us with smiles, how are yous, asking about my father & his progress, coming to help us out if we have any concerns. They are always providing us with messages or goodies left for us by family & friends, and they too have gone out of their way to make us feel welcome.  These 3 staff are always so genuine, and are a great asset to Ramada Inn. They have helped make my family feel welcome, and now that we\u2019ve been going to Ramada every other weekend or so for almost 7 months, I feel like I have found a home away from home, no thanks to the great work and kindness of Mike, Jeff & Joan!  Thanks guys! \u2665\n\n-The maintenance staff are absolutely wonderful. John, the handy man, is great, always coming to do a quick repair as asked, in & out so quickly you wonder how he had time to even fix the bathroom light etc etc. Thanks!\n\n-I also have to say that the housekeeping ladies are soooo sweet! Especially Marijia & Ana, I have grown very fond of these two ladies, they often greet my mom & I with hugs, asking how we\u2019re doing, how my father is doing, and going out of their way to brighten up our day with a big genuine smile, hug or joke of some kind.  They too make Ramada inn feel like a home away from home, and they often remind me of my grandmother, soo sweet, but also, very hardworking \u2665\n\n-The restaurant at Ramada Inn is great! More than fair prices, good quality food, and friendly staff. Tina, Bonnie & Paul surely know my family\u2019s orders off by heart now that we have become regulars, and its great to be able to joke & laugh around with the staff during our meals. They are great at their jobs. We also appreciate the restaurant\u002Fhotel's generosity in providing my family with complementary breakfast coupons, throughout some of our stays here. Given the many trips to London to visit my dad over the past 7 months, and likely in the future, providing those coupons intermittently has been very valuable and helped little by little, alleviate some of the financial stress that having a family member in hospital for so long, can create. Thank you thank you thank you. \u2665\n\n-And it goes without saying, that the cooks, Josh & Rouwel have found their niche, as they make yummy food, and you will never leave Ramada without a full belly.\n\nI could go on and on about the many ways that Ramada has impressed me, and reasons why it is a great, affordable place to stay \u2026 but check it out for yourself, you will be pleasantly surprised \u263A",5,positive

The security doors use your room key to allow entry but, apparently, during the day anyone can just walk in as the secure doors were not activated.  This is only a two-storey building and there is obvious work to be done from the facing of the building and the blinds\u002Fcurtains that look like they're barely hanging on.\nThe room, again, is nice-enough looking but really in need of a few updates.  The television is so old that we could not plug in any of our modern-day accessories (games, camcorder). The alarm clock never worked because ... there was nowhere (near the beds) to plug it in.  It just sits on the night-table, completely useless.  When my husband decided to look around for a place to plug it in, he discovered a half-finished bottle of water lying on the floor near the bed so the cleaning staff had clearly not been thorough.  The bathtub faucet had rust all over it, which grossed out the kids.\nDuring our stay, I decided to try the fitness room while the rest of the family went for a swim.  What a joke - there is one recumbent bike, one treadmill and one elliptical.  The machines were not new but I gave them a go anyway.  Ifigured I'd just watch some TV (looked like a newer TV than in our room) but there was no remote anywhere so I reached up to turn it on and discovered that half the screen was blank and the other half was fuzzy ... on every channel ... so watching TV was out too.  Then I discovered that the bike was the only one piece of equipment that had a water bottle holder.  I gave up after that and sat on the pool deck watching my family swim instead.\nUpon arriving back at home, my husband needed to make an appointment to get his back fixed due to the uncomfortable sleep he got as well - he could barely bend that morning.\nOverall, just an outdated facility and not worth the money in the slightest.\nFor $17 a night more, we could have stayed across the street at the brand new Holiday Inn and the kids eat free there (as opposed to paying the same price as an adult buffet breakfast at Ramada).

Despite the fact that an on-call staff member was kind enough to lend me a bottle of air freshener for the duration of my stay, I bought scented candles, which made it somewhat worse. The walls were paper thin - I could hear ever absurd word out of the neanderthal on the other side of my wall - even though he was simply 'talking'. The absolute worst part of my stay - was the DOG POO! Someone brought a dog, who did its enormous business in the middle of a busy staircase and didn't bother to clean it up!  These inescapable steps are a main route to the parking lot at the back (and dead center) of the building. Dozens of kids from a hockey tournament, were being kids, and running up and down the stairs, hallways, and into their teammate\u2019s rooms so this offensive crap was tracked and smeared all over the carpets - and it stunk beyond imagination. It took FIVE CALLS to have this rectified. This is my greatest complaint. For the price of the hotel, I accepted the smell of my room, the thin walls (and subsequent eyeball rolling conversation of my neighbour), and was incredibly grateful to the gentleman who lent me air freshener. It is completely UNACCEPTABLE that the entire front desk staff avoided contending with an absolutely unhygienic repeated complaint.",1,negative

Seeing as we are returning customers we requested a particular area of rooms we would like to be in. Upon check in we were told that none of those rooms were available. When I told the clerk that had we known we would have cancelled the reservation as we live about one hour away and would have just booked another weekend. She quickly gave us one of the rooms in the area we wanted- I thought this was a little strange, but gladly accepted. Thank you!\n\nOn a side note, I would like to point out that while I was at the desk, a group of 7 people were checking in, and the other clerk would only give them 6 passes to the pool deck, pool, and water slide. The woman was of course upset, and said that when they booked the room for 7 people she should have been told then. She asked if she could purchase an additional pass, and they said no. I am only bringing this up as a warning to any larger groups, I sure would have like to have known too!\n\nOur room was just as expected, and was extremely similar to our last stay. The bathroom had a separate shower and tub, which would be fabulous for families traveling with small children! There is a mini fridge in the room, but no microwave. \n\nWe found the pool area to be much, much colder than last time. We needed to have pants and sleeves to sit out on the balcony and the kids were quite cold coming and going form the pool- this was unexpected. Previously, the kids were in their swimsuits wet or dry, and we comfortably sat in shorts and tank tops.... it was like a tropical climate. \n\nWe ate dinner at the restaurant on site. It was nice not having to drive anywhere, although there are plenty of restaurants very close to the hotel. \n\nThe one thing I would like to advise the hotel itself of, is for the housekeeping staff to check the gardens. There were several wine glasses and pop cans thrown in the gardens by our room- who the heck does that?! You finish a glass of wine and throw the stemware over the balcony? Some people have no class I suppose. I didn't notice anything like this before and I completely think it's a guest issue much more than a hotel issue, but I would hate to see a child accidentally cut themselves.\n\nI would still recommend this hotel, but I am very curious to know when I book in March if I need to bring my parka or my flip flops?!",4,positive

She did give me the band, but asked me \""did you get it when you checked in?\"" with a tone I did not like at all... basically implying \""are you trying to get extra ones to get your friends in the pool\"". So if you do plan to get in the pool, just get the wrist bands when you check in.",3,negative

I agree with some previous reviews.  The hotel is busy.  This is a popular choice for families and sports teams.  The pool was open until 11 pm on Sat. night and opened at 8 am Sunday morning and it is busy.  We stayed on the third floor overlooking the pool.  We went with our children and they loved the view.  For us, traveling with kids, the pool hours were amazing going till 11 pm and and 8 am start on Sunday.  The water slide hours were very good as well (mostly open).  The pool was clean and well monitored.  The pool area is beautiful.  The water slide is very unique and amazing.  The pool water was warm and shallow in many parts for kids and easy to stand.  Although busy, there was room enough for everyone and the water slide line up was never more then a few minutes.  Beach balls in the pool area, a fish pond in the atrium.  Tonnes of towels and lots of chairs.  Room was very clean.  Separate shower and tub.  Sink outside of the bathroom is very convenient.  Shelly's restaurant onsite was busy but servers and the manager were working hard.  Food was very good.  Price of meals for adults $10.99-$12.99 more for steaks.  Kids meals $4.99.  Excellent hours and all day breakfast menu options offered.  No need to eat out as the hotel doesn't over price their food.  Nice TV, clean, nice beds.  Will go back for sure.  Notes, it is true that if you want a quiet room because you are adult travelers who want a quiet night or if you have small kids with early bed time hours don't stay facing the pool.  There were people in the pool until close 11 pm.  The steps going down the pool are a little slippery...they have caution signs so walk slow.  We did hear some noise at 1:30 am.  Security must have acted quickly as the noise was quickly stopped.  Our kids said it was one of their favorite hotels and felt like they were in a tropical paradise.

We booked these rooms a year ago, and specifically requested rooms on pool level, facing the pool, with patios so we could come and go from the pool and easily monitor the kids in the pool. Also, by having adjoining rooms we'd have a large patio area so we could socialise and have the food we brought and not have to cram inside one room.\n\nWhen we arrived we were told our reservation didn't specify any room preferences and that they don't reserve specific rooms. This is not what we were told when reserving! We all live in the London area, so this stay was not about needing a room, it was about the pool and being together and having the patio space. To not have that defeated the whole purpose. We complained and complained but in the end we were stuck with two interior rooms, and ONE BALCONY room in a different section which overlooked the pool, but you had to go into the hall and down the stairs to get there. This meant that we were all crammed in the one room as we didn't want to be. I felt we wasted our $ as we only used the other two rooms to sleep, and just as easily could have gone home instead (which we were tempted to do but the kids wanted to use the pool the next day as well). \nWe know lots of people who stay here for the same reason. We felt we were not treated fairly. We booked the rooms a whole year earlier to be guaranteed what we wanted. As for their excuse they don't reserve specific rooms, the manager offerred to guarantee rooms for us if we return this year, and oddly some rooms had already been reserved so this wasn't just done for us.\n\nOn a good note, I think the restaurant food is actualy quite good! The menu has a good variety, especially breakfast! The rooms seemed clean. The pool was chilly, as usual. We weren't going to rebook but decided that, if we can get the rooms we want, it's still a good New Years place to be.",3,negative

We paid the CAA\u002FAAA rate of approximately $116 plus tax for a junior suite (about $10 more than the standard room price) for the extra space this afforded.\n\nThe pool at the Lamplighter is excellent, and well beyond what one would normally expect from a hotel of any chain, at any price point.  It is large, located in an impressive atrium, and includes a water slide for older kids.  Indeed, the property is basically built around the pool, with interior rooms overlooking the atrium to benefit from the pleasant -- almost tropical -- feel this creates.  As the photos clearly show, many of the interior rooms have balconies that allow you to sit out and \""enjoy the view,\"" which is certainly pleasant.\n\nThe downside of this hotel is that you pay handsomely for this privilege.  Many hotels in the area (adjacent to the 401 on Wellington St.) can be booked for much lower prices, while downtown hotels such as the Hilton and Delta are often available at comparable rates.  None of these, of course, offer the pool and atrium of the Lamplighter.  So the real decision to be made is how much the pool is worth to you.\n\nOur general assessment of the hotel is that it is starting to get a bit tired.  The general decor is late 1980s (plenty of interior brick, lots of dark colors), with some updating apparent where this could be done at reasonable cost.  The rooms themselves are similarly dated, which may be a concern for some and a total non-issue for others.  In general, the rooms are maintained at a reasonable level, though there was some evidence of wear-and-tear.  This is, of course, perfectly normal.  But it is undoubtedly not as pleasant as a brand new or thoroughly renovated property.\n\nA few specific notes about the rooms.  The bed, while adequate, was not among the most comfortable we have slept in.  The pull-out sofabed, meanwhile, made for a positively unpleasant sleeping experience; I would not recommend it for more than one night, or for anyone with even the slightest back issue.  It's also worth noting that the patio door that exits onto the atrium cannot be opened with the room key when locked, making it necessary to walk all the way through the hotel when heading to or returning from the pool, even if your room is on the ground floor.\n\nOne final note: I understand that this hotel hosts many events (wedding receptions, etc.) that are hosted in or near the atrium.  While there were no issues with this during our stay, I imagine noise could be an issue for rooms with an atrium exposure if there were music or other amplified sound.  Worth considering when choosing a room, or even when deciding whether this hotel is the right choice for you.\n\nStaff were pleasant, though not exceptionally so.  Neither a plus nor a minus for us.\n\nOverall, I think this is a perfectly pleasant hotel at $80 a night.  At $120, ask yourself how much the pool is really worth to you.  Based on guestroom alone, there are more luxurious and less expensive options available.",3,negative

Our children (3yrs and 1yr) loved the pool, and even had a little fun in the game\u002Farcade room! We stayed in a King Suite room, with an atrium view and walkout balcony. We found the room very accommodating for small children. We were able to put the kids to bed in a seperate room (the sitting area) and still enjoy the balcony and bedroom area of the hotel room. The view off the balcony was relaxing (with the waterfalls and plants), and made for good people watching.  The room decor could use an update but it certainly wasn't horrible. Our only complaint was the mattress. We found it to be far too soft. Perhaps it's just personal preference but we definitely would have preferred a mattress that was more firm. My husband and I both woke up with a sore neck and back. In the morning  we enjoyed a lovely breakfast at the attached restaurant Shelly's Tap & Grill. End of the day, the hotel served its purpose.

Needless to say the pool and hot tub was overflowing with children of all ages, but that is what they are there for.  The water slide was open and kids were enjoying the added amenity.  It was kind of funny, a young lifeguard was trying to enforce the rules of only 7 people in the hot tub at a time and no one under the age of 5 allowed in...after a while, it became a hopeless situation and while he was attending to other duties, the hot tub quickly filled up with about 15 little kids and a few adults...pretty cute picture, wish I had my camera...realize the safety issue involved, but as long as the adults in the hot tub supervised the situation, should be no issues...except for babies in diapers, that I don't agree with.

Lots of sunlight through the glass.\nRoom: Was nicely layed out with a couple of steps going down to the bedroom and walkout patio. Had 2 TVs, microwave and fridge.Very comfortable. It cost a little more than some other rooms but I think worth it. \nCon's:\nAtrium: They offer wedding ceremonies which require the entire atrium to be shut down ( including pool and waterslide) for the afternoon. That was the case the Sunday we stayed. This wasn't a huge deal to us but if you had kids with you and the pool and slide were closed..yikes. \nFront Desk: The person behide that desk was so unwelcoming she left you feeling like you should have apologized for interupting and checking in. Just a rude person who clearly doesn't like her job and I only fault management for the staffing. Serious;y, how can the place be considered Plus staus? \nThe desk clerk did alert us however to the afternoon closing of the Atrium..after we were handed our keys.

We had our bags with us and we went through check in process and told at the end that our room was not ready and that we could come back later for the keys.

data/ca/154995/182029/20292595.html,Best Western Plus Lamplighter Inn &amp; Conference Centre,"""The first time I visited London, Ontario was in February 2007.  I was wondering what I should do during the four hour trip on Via Rail from Toronto. I helped myself to several complimentary newspapers from the Panorama Lodge at Union Station. It so happened that an  87 year old lady sat next to me. We shared  many conversations and an elegantly served breakfast of ham and eggs, fresh fruits, cereals, juice, coffee and warm croissants.  This rail ride has now become  a pleasant memory. My new companion had traveled to many places around the world and is still active in our Toronto community. \u201CI like to swim, and I asked my husband to build an indoor swimming pool at home, so I could enjoy swimming all year around\u201D.   I was amazed at the amount of energy this lady had. It is true what people say that it is not the actual age of a person, it is how the person feels about themselves that counts.   I have seen people in their teens that are already old. \nThe story about the swimming pool reminded me of the previous week that I spent in Antigua, and my suntan reminded of the warm turquoise water.  London\u2019s snowbanks, after the snowstorm, reminded me of the outstanding Antiguan white-sand beaches. Yes, it was only a week ago that I was there and I already miss the Caribbean warmth.\n\nThe concierge at the \u201CBest Western Lamplighter\u201D gave me the key for my room, and after rolling my suitcase throughout corridors I finally found my room on the third floor.   First, as usual, I checked the bathroom. Okay, it was clean and roomy, with plenty of towels. Second, I opened the curtains to look at the view from my window. Wow, I had a feeling of De ja vue.   From the balcony I could see turquoise water and palm trees! The hotel\u2019 courtyard has a large swimming pool, jacuzzi and a waterslide under a huge glass ceiling. Then, I looked up. The snowpile on the huge glass ceiling was a good reminder of yesterday\u2019s snowstorm. \n\n Within a  few minutes I was in that pool swimming and reliving my Antiguan \u201Cdejavue\u201D.  During my meetings at the conference in London, the thought of the palm trees and the turquoise water in the hotel swimming pool was in constantly on my mind. Each morning and evening I soaked in the pool. \n\nThere were other interesting experiences such as watching the roof tops from the second floor of the travel equipment store, Novack\u2019s, from a Russian military submarine periscope.  Other highlights of my trip were a beer tasting tour at Labbatt Brewery, The Eldon House, The Banting house, where insulin was invented, and The Children\u2019s Museum.\n\nBefore my second trip to London, I contacted the London Tourist Office to inquire if there was anything that might be of interest to my two kids.  They suggested that we visit The Children\u2019s Museum , Storybook Gardens, and take a tour on London\u2019s double decker bus.  I had arranged our second trip to London in August of 2008. Making our drive was not too hard on the kids,and break the four hours trip into halves, we made reservation for the old Steam train ride from Waterloo to St. Jacobs.  Our son Jonathan was so excited to be on a real, old steam train. All three passenger cars were nicely restored. This time, seated next to us was an old, big, stuffed Teddy bear, that could possibly have been 87 years old too.  Although the majority of the passengers were other families with kids, I noticed that there were many young , newly wed couples as well as several seniors.\n\nAfter a half hour ride, we spent the next couple of hours in the downtown section of St. Jacob, visiting museums, galleries and many giftshops on the main street of the town.. The market was our next stop. We spent two short hours at the market looking at handcrafts, watching the Mennonites  and their wagons, taking the kids on pony rides and tasting Polish kielbasa.  \n\nThe last minutes of driving to London were extremely difficult for us. Our daughter no longer had any  patience to sit in the car and we were anxiously searching for the  \u201CLamplighter\u201D sign.  After we located the hotel and found our room, my wife opened the curtains and I heard the same \u201CWow\u201D that I exclaimed last February when I was last here.  In few minutes the entire family was soaking and jumping in the pool under the palm trees.  Our son, Jonathan, was not yet tall enough to enjoy the waterslide at the pool.   But, my wife and I became teenagers again and slid down the waterslide a couple of times.\n\nWhen we came back to our room to change for dinner, Jonathan exclaimed.\n\u201CDaddy, can we stay here for a week, or for a couple of weeks?\nAfter dinner, Jonathan was in a tremendous hurry for us to change to our swim suits so that  we could go back to play in the swimming pool. That Saturday evening the hotel\u2019s swimming pool was packed with families with kids. Perhaps they are also repeat guests of this hotel, just like me!",5,positive

There were plenty of lifeguards, towels and chairs.  The rooms were decent (in keeping with most Best Westerns).  Restaurant food was passable with many selections.  However, each time we used the restaurant or bar, the service was very slow.  There was no host\u002Fhostess on duty on a Friday night, and servers ignored us standing at the door for 15 minutes.  On Saturday morning, we got a table faster, but no one even took an order for coffee for about 20 minutes.  Very disappointed as the restaurant experience made us want to avoid it, and detracted from an otherwise very pleasant stay.

The Best western plus near us, has rooms that walk out onto the play area from the ground floor, so based on other review here, we requested that at this property. When we got to our room, the balcony looked out over the pool, (#177) but there was no immediate access.  We decided to go look around the pool area and see if there were any other options, and we found rooms overlooking the pool, directly near a stairwell leading down to it. (#115 odd to #125). While exploring we ran into the manager, Jim Bay, and he talked it over with us, and quickly rearranged things to move us to our choice of rooms. (#115) it was great!  We could sit and see the water slide and the pool from our vantage point, and the stairs to the pool were so close!! There are chairs outside each patio door with a small table, and the room was super clean and comfortable! These rooms have a queen bed and pull out sofa bed, which worked for us, the kids took the sofa bed -each have a tv too! We found out during the stay, that the rooms behind the water slide have 2 queens, but not a clear view as we had.  \nWe ate in the attached restaurant the first afternoon, and food was very good, and the server, Jill was very friendly and helpful! We ordered room service the second night and it was fast and delicious.  \nOnly negative really was the game room. 5 games and air hockey -run on tokens and vary between 2 tokens (1 game) and 5 (air hockey) tokens cost 3\u002F$1. 2 of the games ate our tokens, and none of the games are very good for younger kids-at least ours (8,6)\nIt was also very warm in there, and bright!! Kids didn't care, but as we didn't send them alone, we did! I didn't expect the size or set up of a large kid resort such as Great Wolf, but a little tlc here would be well appreciated. My hubby and I loved the 80's Galaga\u002FMs paceman. \nAlthough fridge included, a microwave would have been a feature we would have used, as well as a clothes hanger\u002Fdryer for wet suits. \nAlso, other similar properties allow you to buy extra wristbands for the pool for visitors, at a day rate if the hotel isn't full, we would have loved to invite our friends over with their children, but there is only a max of 5 wristbands per room allowed.

Friday March 11 . We booked through airmiles which was awesome and saved us lots of money . Since we had 5 children and 2 adults we had to book 2 rooms . Air miles made the reservation but I called and kindly asked to be side by side . When I arrived I had my fingers crossed that they would be side by side which they were , the enterences were even kinda facing each other which made going from room to room easier .. we figured the pool would be crazy busy with it being March break but it really wasn't . 2 out of the 5 kids I had weren't tall enough to use the slide which broke one of their hearts . But the lifeguards were so nice but firm on the height requirements and they even let one of my kids keep them company while the others used the slide . She was soo happy , She kept calling them her friends and she and the lifeguards knew each other by name .. thanks Sam , Chris , Fin,  Tre?  They even took her to feed the fish . Everythime I went up the lifeguards were always laughing and joking with all my kids even the older ones which sang them songs and did funny things back . I'm not sure which lifeguard it was but my broken hearted child that couldnt ride the slide came back soo excited .. she said he told her that if she went to bed really good and got enough sleep that she could possibly grow enough to ride the slide tomorrow . I thank him very much on two different levels . Lol . The hotel was super clean , not one complaint , I even seen a maid cleaning the spiral cord to the phone . Great job lamp lighter .

Highly doubt any of that happened. Just going way overboard to justify a ridiculously high charge for us having no affect on their business. I understand charging if people are unreasonable, try and lie their way out of the charge, and inconsiderate; as in actually making a mess or not caring about the hotels amenities, but we were none of the above. When I called about the charge I was just honest, open and overly apologetic about her actions and everything I've said here about our thoughts on the charge. This approach yielded nothing at all.

We especially loved the retractable roof as it sent a nice breeze in and some natural sunlight!  Close to lots of restaurants.  We went to Cora's down the road and the Mandarin.  Timmies was just up the street as well.  I had only a couple of concerns during our stay.  The doors to the pool area and the entire hotel to the rooms were unlocked which means anyone could have come in.  We had wrist bands to be in the pool area the first day but after that the adults in our group didn't wear them at all.

The other issue is we should be able to bring in food to be eaten in the atrium from outside and not just from the hotel...(See Best Western Cairn Croft)  Many families there bring to their own food to save costs or bring in pizza,KFC etc.  Also add a patio table outside every room as an additional eating space and place to read the paper!!

Jill was always super busy running back and forth throughout the restaurant, serving and accommodating all the tables that she possibly could, but she would still go out of her way to make sure that we were taken care of in a timely manner and she also made sure that we got our food while it was still hot. Our stay in London was quite unexpected when our daughter was suddenly medi-vacked down from Northern Ontario and we didn\u2019t have very much extra money on hand but we still made sure to tip Jill (and other waitresses) what we could when we could and Jill was always appreciative and friendly regardless, she even helped us figure our way around to the close by shopping centres and showed us an app on her phone that could tell us how long it would take to get to where we were going.

Check in was fast.  They ask you for your cell phone number when you arrive and they send you a welcome text. After that you can text them for anything you need instead of calling the front desk. I found this very helpful. I send them a text and they reply immediately, it is a great option of communication. My room was on the first floor, very close to the pool area.The hallway smelled like chlorine. The room was very comfortable, very clean and very comfortable bed. The down side was that the furnace was very noisy, so every time the furnace started I could hear the noise of the fan. The room had a Jacuzzi tub. They have a big pool which I did not use but it looks very nice and popular. The other bad point of this hotel is that it does not have breakfast in the morning. There is a restaurant attached to it, but if you are in a hurry and need to eat something fast I do not recommend this restaurant at all!!! I sat there for 30 minutes and didn't get any food. There are many other places for fast breakfast in the morning close to the hotel, including a Tim Horton's. \nThe hotel is in a great location on Wellington Ave, which is the main street in London and the one that brings you from the 401 to downtown London, it is 6 minutes away from the Hwy 401. The hotel is very close to downtown also probably 5 minutes and very close to the hospital. There are many options for dinner close by.\nI would stay there again and give them a second chance but I will probably ask for a room upstairs.

We had a 1 king bed, non-atrium view suite.  The room was clean and nice.  The suite was the first room through the main entrance of this wing.  \n\nThe bedroom portion can be closed off from the living area with glass French doors.  The bedroom faced the parking lot.  The drapes were blackout curtains and I kept the drapes closed because it felt like anyone standing in the parking lot could easily just look straight into the room.   The bedroom had a TV, lots of lights, drawers and comfortable bed.  \n\nThe bathroom area has a full bathtub on 1 side, toilet in the middle and separate shower on the other side.  The shower has a shampoo, conditioner and bath gel dispenser on the wall and these did not reflect the quality of the rest of the hotel.  The first day, the shampoo was empty but housekeeping did rectify this the next day when we advised her.  There was no dispenser on the bathtub side and no separate shampoo, conditioner and soap available so unless one was to get out of the tub and get the shampoo, conditioner and bath gel from the shower area, the tub would only be good for soaking in.  \n\nDirectly across from the bathroom area is the separate sink area on 1 side and open closet on the other.  The sink surface area is small and since the coffee and tea maker and condiments are also on this counter space, there is very little space to put your toiletry\u002Fcosmetic bag.  They certainly could use some shelf space either under the counter or on the sides to put toiletry items on.  There was 1 small square bar of soap in this area and it tended to leave a yucky smell on your hands, not immediately but within a short while.  Again, it felt like cheap quality bath amenities.  The hairdryer was small and not powerful so if you have long hair, I recommend that you bring your own.  \n\nIn the living area, there was a pull out sofa bed.  As with most sofa beds, this was far from comfortable.  There is a small bar fridge, table and TV.  Since it was right at the doorway to the room, I found it to be noisy to sleep here.  The door didn\u2019t provide any soundproofing for the noise in the hallways (people talking and banging room doors).  Thank goodness for ear plugs.  \n\nAlso, the room fan is loud.  If you like a quiet room with no noise from the fan, then you won\u2019t be able to get any sleep in this room.  Once again, hurray for ear plugs!\n\nThe resort\u2019s front lobby is under construction and so the front desk is just a desk in a small narrow space under construction.  Nothing much to look at right now.  \n\nThe atrium and swimming area is spacious.  The pool temperature was just right.  There is a small hot tub next to the pool and also, the waterslide is up on top, overlooking the pool.  The waterslide doesn\u2019t flow into the main pool area.  It flows into a separate pool.  There were plenty of towels available, some lawn chairs around the pool area and a lovely separate pond area for their koi fish.  \n\nI heard that there was a police officer on duty there which I felt was a smart idea done by the hotel.  There were a number of groups staying at the hotel and groups can be noisy and rambunctious.  My understanding was that the police officer had to reprimand a couple of children but that it was done in as nice a way as possible.  Scared the pants off of the children though (who wants to be stopped by the police?) but by having a police offer on duty, it allows the other guests who are not part of a group to enjoy their stay, too.  \n\nOverall, a great stay at the Best Western Lamplighter Inn in London.

The gym is quite small, sporting just a few dated machines, but at least it's something. The onsite restaurant, Shelly's, offers a great breakfast deal for an amazing price ($4.99, I think). We enjoyed our breakfast, and couldn't argue with the value. We also had one dinner there, which was excellent, but the service (by a very friendly but seriously overworked waitress who had the whole restaurant to herself) was super slow.\n\nThe only real downside was the noise from the hall. There must have been a hockey tournament in town or something, as we heard groups of kids pounding down the hall all night. But that's it, really - overall, this was an excellent stay with a hotel that exceeded our expectations. I would not hesitate to stay there again.",4,positive

On the plus side the beds were quite nice and made well and the bathroom was clean aside from not having conditioner for your hair. Another\u2019s negative issue I had was the remote control being unresponsive at times and the television kept switching to 16:9 instead of staying on just scan.

However, if you don't like screaming, loud kids running around, be warned. We asked for a room overlooking the pool, when we booked a month in advance, but were placed as far from the pool as possible. This may have been a blessing in disguise, as the hotel probably did us a favour keeping us far from the antics of pre teen boy hockey teams and their negligent parents.

Everything was clean anywhere we went in the hotel.  \nThe pool would be the show stopper at this hotel.  As well as the fact that it seems to be central in location.

It is very difficult to find a hotel with a good restaurant attached (I\u2019m never quite sure why that is) it was oddly expensive?  Not sure why it was so pricy?  Crabby Joes was good as we ate there after walking out of Shelly\u2019s.  London has a lot of good restaurants other than what is offered near the hotel but we were hungry and had our 8 year old boy.  \nFYI, \u201Cpiping kettle\u201D nearby.  Great for a lunch spot.\n\nA quick mention of the gym...  I am an avid gym goer so I usually use the gyms during hotel stays.  This gym has enough equipment to get an \u201Cok\u201D workout in.

The rooms and beds were comfortable, and there were games for the children.  \nI would have recommended this hotel to anyone until we checked out - At which point there was a discrepancy with the bill.  As a status indian, I do not pay PST on purchases, and have never done so in the past.  The manager was very rude.  She raised her voice with me and said, \""I know for a fact that you must pay tax unless it is for something you are taking to a reservoir\""!  (I corrected her here, as I believe she meant to say 'reservation' - for those of you who are unfamiliar with this, a reservation is a place where the federal government restricted First Nations people to live during the formation of Canada.  Reservations still exist today, yet there are now curfews anymore)\nFor those of you who are of First Nations descent, I do not recommend this hotel.  I found the customer service to be rude and racist.  Fortunately, upon investigation, I can be reimbursed for the taxes paid by revenue canada, yet it is such a shame that the manager was so mean.  Not only did she yell, the other staff who were there snickered at me.  Although I understand that many people in Canada are unaware of the tragedies that have been done to the First Nations and therefore misunderstand why we do have minimal rights, such as PST exemption, I still do believe that the use of kindness and basic customer service should be of utmost priority for hotel management.  \nI am very disappointed with my treatment at this hotel.",1,negative

You dont notice from the road just how big this hotel is, it was hard to find our room the first time.

The A\u002FC worked, but just barely- I would not want to see how warm this room would become in the heat of the summer!  The fridge was the same deal- just cool enough to chill our wine a little bit, but it could have been a little better.

The first time I came here, I was 10 years old, and all I can remember is that I had the time of my life! So that tells you right there that the pool area is amazing for younger children. The pool is large, there is a hot tub beside it, and a water slide carved into an elevated, fake lighthouse that ends in its own little pool of water, which creates a waterfall effect if you stand underneath of it. \n\nMy second stay here was after my prom. I had to proms to attend, and we had party plans after the second one so my boyfriend and I made our own plans for the first one. We got a room here for one night just to enjoy the pool and being away from home. Our room was very large and clean, it had a king sized bed, a couch with flatscreen TV mounted on the wall, and a separate area with the dinning table and chairs. And of course the bathroom, which had a shower and a separate bathtub in it. The pool was just as I remembered it! And we had a couple friends come over to take a swim as well. The front desk gave us a couple extra wristbands for them, free of charge. One of these friends used to stay here around Christmas every year just for the pool when he was younger. \n\nShelly's restaurant is where we had dinner that night, its attached to the hotel. It is very nice! The food is pretty good, the prices are fairly average, and the service is excellent. You can also have the bill charged to your room if you're staying in the hotel.  \n\nAs I mentioned, I do live in London and have all my life, so I know this area very well. The location is right beside White Oaks mall, which is a very large mall with hundreds of stores and a large food court. It's right near the biggest hospital in London, and less than a 10 minute drive downtown if you're interested in any of the great restaurants there. There are several restaurants around the area as well. \n\nIt is a little bit more pricey than a lower-classed motel or hotel, but I would definitely recommend it if you have a little bit of extra money and just want to be pampered, even for just a day or two.

Not to mention the hair we had to remove from the kids that they accumulated from being in the pool. After speaking to management (who did nothing) he explained that the reason for no drinks around the pool was due to people who abused the rule and brought alcohol and treated their hotel as an \""all inclusive\"" resort?? \uD83D\uDE33.

The kids were running up and down the halls, screaming, slamming doors and playing mini-sticks. The parents were drinking, listening to loud music, yelling at each other over the music and swearing in the room next to mine. On three separate occasions other patrons asked the parents to keep the noise down. One guest indicated he had a baby sleeping in a room nearby. This did not deter the parents. I called\u002Ftexted the front desk 5 times. They sent someone each time to ask the parents to keep the noise down and make sure their kids did the same...to no avail. The hotel has a strict \""no noise\"" policy after 11:00pm which I hoped they would enforce. Sadly this was not the case and I was awake until 2:30am.

Thank you, Lamplighter Inn.\n\nAs I asked about the room at check-in, the young lady said she was upgrading our room to a King suite at no additional cost as it is the quietest room in the hotel.

The King Suite is on the other side of the building)\n\nThe parking lot is spacious and wraps around the entire complex.

This rarely happens when we travel and might be the first time.\n\nThe suite has a living room with desk, phone and free Wi-Fi.  I believe I saw an Ethernet connection also.  A good sized HDTV is on the wall facing a 3-seat sofa and coffee table.  Very comfortable area to do some work, catch up on emails and\u002For watch TV.\n\nThe bathroom sink is in a separate room directly across from the bathroom.  A small coffee maker is on the sink vanity with a good number of regular and decaf coffees.  In the bathroom you have a choice of walk-in shower or standard tub.

In fact, the entire complex appears to be new.\n\nThe bedroom was large with another HDTV easily watched from the bed.  \n\nWe don't have any young children, but took a walk to the pool area.  Very impressive, with a waterfall, large pool and a very large water-slide for the kids.  All enclosed under a massive dome.  \n\nI didn't take any pictures as they would not have done justice to this wonderful hotel.  I suggest you take the time to look at the many images on the web site.\n\nThe location is on Wellington Road, extremely easy to go into downtown London and also to Route 401.

The staff does not seem to care about their guests at all. \nHe even dared to bring up a visit from 2017 which I had the same problem with being given the wrong room after paying so much!

The lady explained all of the ammeneties and gave directions to popular local tourist attractions.  When we left the frontdesk, I must say that I was very impressed with the service that we had already recieved.  We walked past the atrium area to get to our hotel room.

We booked the honeymoon suite that is almost 300$ all taxes included. The room is average nothing special and the same size as any other room.  Except a jacuzzi and king size bed.  We arrived the day before and held the room with our visa this was for a anniversary for my husband and I and my birthday, so the room was for us and our friends were all meeting us in the atrium for 8pm until our limo arrived to take us out on the town.. As you can imagine we were making sure all our arrangements were working out according to plan and the last thing we needed to worry about was our accommodations. (that we thought was taken care of) well my visa could not hold the amount of the whole room since we had other expenses for the evening planed with limos reservations at other events.  They were not going to allow us to even check in our room and with hair appointments at 5pm and people set to arrive at 8pm this was very stressful at the last minute and not to mention embarrassing in front of all the other people at the front desk,  plus for 300$ a night we hoped to at least enjoy the pool and work out room before we went to our appointments.  After they were finished embarrassing us at the front desk the manager realized that my visa is valid and also that is is illegal not to except cash as a mode of payment for any business. The pool was fun (for the short time we got to use it) but when we returned just the 2 of of us to enjoy the jacuzzi after our night out and it would not empty and we could not use it,  which was the main reason of getting the 300$ a night room and not a regular room for our anniversary,  the fridge had also  melted our personalized 50$ ice-cream birthday cake.  All of this is not the fault of one person and especially not  the staff,  and I am not the type of person to complain about things out of mine and other peoples control, but the banging on our room door at 11am on the dot ( I know check out is 11 but we thought that since we were in the suite and paid so much for out room and it was a special occasion and I do stay in plenty of nice hotels and always book the suite that they would of late us stay for a late check out I also have to point out that I have never been denied a late check out EVER and I have also asked other people their thought on this and they agree) the angry man who banged on our door was so rude he was loud and when we were obviously half awake and asked if we had time to pack up he yelled \""nope\"" and left.  I felt like a teenager running around packing my stuff with no time to have a shower or brush our teeth or enjoy anything left in the room.(when we went down to the front desk as fast as we could to check out and pay for our accommodations we asked for the name of the man who banged on our door and in our opinion was unnecessarily rude and mean no one knew his name but after I became a little upset and even scared that they don't know who in their hotel did that they finally gave me the name James one of the many managers.     I just guess I took for granted the nice and pleasant staff at other hotels and I can honestly say I have never been treated like this before.  I guess I also thought the staff would care that it was a special evening for us and we thought they would at least try to make our stay a little more memorable. I also have to point out that after reading other reviews on this helpful site that there is some other guest that had the same experience with the same nasty staff.\n",1,negative

Had not been to this hotel for 10 years and after this trip would recommend it.\n\nThe lifeguard staff were excellent. Could be a horrible job sitting doing nothing all day and have seen many places where staff, especially younger staff get lax in performing their duties. This trip lifeguards Michelle, Mallory and the young man whose name now alludes me were all attentive, assuring all the kids were safely using the slide and were quick to remind children of the rules when necessary. \n\nMallory in particular made an extra effort to encourage my girl who was a little intimidated with trying the slide out at first - It was the confidence boost she needed to get going and before long had gone down the slide 50 times. Was also nice for me knowing I could leave my 8 year-old to enjoy the slide and staff were actively monitoring the kids.\n\nFor a room we got a King suite that was facing the outside. The room had lots of space, was comfortable and looked very new. (not sure if they had recently renovated). Also liked the way the doors are recessed from the hallway so you don't get as much noise from people in the hallway.\n\nUnfortunately we only stayed one night so really didn't get a chance to settle in and truly enjoy the pool - which looks amazing at night. Next time we're planning to do two nights so we can really get a good visit in. Because we were there on a holiday Monday we had the opportunity to use the slide both in the evening and in the morning however if you are planning a visit with children to use the slide it is open limited hours during the week so you may want to double check times before planning your trip.",5,positive

We wanted an overnight getaway for my daughter's birthday so we came to the Lamplighter because a friend mentioned how he loved it when he went. The room was great and clean. It overlooked the pool and we could walk straight out and into the pool area through sliding doors. One thing most hotels with pools don't get right is the temperature but this hotel had it perfect. The temperature in the pool area was warm, the pool water was warm too. I never really felt like I couldn't just wade in.The pool was the most important thing for me because that was specifically why we went there and we weren't disappointed. Even the waterslide was the perfect length and thrill for my 9 year old daughter. You have to be 4' though so my 6 year old couldn't use it but she wasn't bothered by it anyway. \n\nPROS \n- Great pool area as mentioned above. \n- Room was on the 100 level so we could walk right out the living room area of the room through sliding doors and down to the pool without having to take elevators etc.It also had a little patio area outside the room for us to chill in while the kids slept or for the kids to read in the morning. \n- Restaurant onsite was great value for the breakfast. Our family at for $30 before tax. Kids meals were $5.99 so very appropriately priced. My wife and I got the special which was like $8 each and was large for that price. \n- Area around the hotel had a lot of stores etc so I could go to Starbucks in the morning in a couple of minutes. There was also a pizza place called Pizza Tonite around the corner that was decent. \n\nCONS - Not really but just things to keep in mind\n- I think the hotel is a popular place to stay for hockey teams and they were definitely there when we were. It was a bit busy in the pool area at times (but not too crowded) but when the team(s) had a game it emptied out. By 8p-830pthe games for the day must have been over and it got pretty rambunctious in the pool, but we had our fill so we were out by then. Anyway, just something to be mindful of. \n- Room. This is not a fault of the hotel at all, but again just be mindful. We booked through Hotwire, and got a room for a family. There were two beds but one bed is a pull out couch. Not a big deal as we have kids to sleep on the couch, but something to keep in mind. If you are booking through the hotel, and picking your room, this wouldn't be a surprise, but again just something to keep in mind. \n\nAll in all, I would highly recommend the Lamplighter.

The atrium was good, although a more seating or towel placement would be good. There was a sign that said we were to shower first before entering pool but we never found the location for it. No biggie. The lifeguards on duty were friendly and a nice added bonus as I was under the impression the pool was slated as a level B which would mean no lifeguards. Towels were \nwarm and big. Slip free surface around the pool and staff were constantly maintaining safety hazards and water. Was a great relief as it was quite busy on Saturday.\nThe only downfall, which was no fault of the Inn was someone pulled the fire alarm shortly after 2 am which had everyone in the motel hurrying outside in a frantic rush.

The only signs we could find were to rooms. As a first time visit, it would have been beneficial and a time saver to have those in place. Other than that, thumbs up!",5,positive

We were very glad to have chosen this one! We had our two kids, ages 3 and 7 with us and they were thrilled with the great pool area and water slide. It was a great way for them to burn off some pent up energy after so much time in the car. \n\nThe hotel was clean and modern. The lobby area was very nice. Plenty of free parking. It's conveniently located near many restaurant options, including a good one right in the hotel. There is a nearby mall and it's a short drive to the 401. It's close enough to downtown that it's a quick drive, but far enough that you're away from the busier city traffic. \n\nThe pool was great. Nice warm water, well kept, cool tropical feel. Kids also loved the large koi pond next to the pool. \n\nWe were able to save $20 by using our CAA discount, so that was also a nice perk. I would recommend this hotel.",5,positive

The pool is a taste of a warmer climate, without the traveling required. The best place for a stay-cation. The staff went above and beyond for everything we needed. They responded in a timely manner, and I was always greeted with a smile. We required a pack n' play for our daughter to sleep in, as well as a few extra things and they had absolutely no problems getting us what we needed. The room service was wonderful as well, GREAT food and HUGE portions for an affordable price! Our room was the perfect size, and I appreciated all the amenities. The hotel is gigantic with three different wings all surrounding the pool area, some with even a lookout to the pool. It was just the most wonderful experience. The downside seemed we were in the same hallway as a bunch of groups with preteen\u002Fteenagers. As parents of a small infant, it made bedtime difficult. However, that is not the hotels fault. I would HIGHLY suggest staying here, they made our two day stay wonderful. It was the best hotel I've ever stayed in, we will be staying here from now on. We actually extended our stay by a day, just to soak up the fun in the pool area. We totally didn't expect our experience, as we just needed a place to stay because our house had a flood. I think we will need to take more stay-cations and hang out here a few times a year!\n\nThe only feedback I have would maybe have a little spot for the younger children, under 3 or 4 years of age. My daughter (14 months) had trouble in the pool with the active older kids not paying attention to their surroundings. So maybe a little playroom somewhere like the games room or small wadding pool, something for the littles. Otherwise it was wonderful!",5,positive

But unfortunately it was far too cold. My kids lips turned blue and shivery within minutes and we could only stay in the pool for up to 10-15 min total. On top of that, the hot tub was so crowded we couldn't stay in there longer than 5 minutes before getting booted out by staff (likely because no one wanted to actually be in the pool). We booked two nights to be able to really take advantage, but my fish of a son didn't even want to go in because of how cold it was. That was just really disappointing for us.\nOtherwise, the room is very nice and clean and the staff are great. But if I was just looking for a comfortable bed, I would have stayed home. Sorry to have to be a bit blunt, but when I heard so many people around me commenting the same thing when they were getting in the pool, I knew I wasn't just being sensitive. \nTIP: Bring your own beach towel, bathing suit covers and flip flops to get around. They don't have a change room near the pool and it feels awkward to walk around in just your bathing suit. They supply towels by the pool, but can't bring them to your room after (so you tend to be a bit cold walking back).",3,negative

When I arrived at 7AM after traveling by plane all night, it was a problem. It took over 90 mins to check in because they had to use greeting staff from the front desk to clean a room as there were no maids available. The rooms are in need of renovations and updating, this is not your usual \""Howard Johnson's\"". Pillows are old, lumpy and sheets are very wrinkled. Towels are stained. The glass on the night table was filthy, it was not cleaned once during my 7 night stay. The \""Free Continental Breakfast\"" is a joke!

The walls between rooms are paper thin and you can pretty much hear whatever goes on in the next room including two people getting busy with each other.  My last night was the worst. I finally got to sleep just after 4AM due to the people next door on BOTH sides. On one side I had sexual noises and the other was partying noises which could be heard well down the hall. There were many complaints made about the partying room. I asked to switch rooms (I was not in the correct room from the beginning due to lack of rooms available and was told that they would let me know when the room I had booked was available) & was told that they were booked solid by an older woman at the desk. Yet later on, the young manager told me that they had several rooms available when I commented to him outside about the place being full. This tells me that the first woman probably didn't want to do the transfer. Nothing was done about the noise other than them calling the people in the room who were causing the problem.

I made the original booking through the Howard Johnson website, which went smoothly. We checked into our room around 7pm the night of our stay. After a quick look around, I noticed that there was a long black hair sitting on the edge of the bathtub. I hoped that this did not indicate the shower had not been cleaned, but who knows. \n\nAfter visiting with my family that evening, I decided that I wanted to stay an extra night to be with them. I spoke with the man at the front desk who told me this would not be a problem. When he attempted to book my room for the extra night, apparently the booking software was being very slow and not working. He said he would sort it out for me and that we could go back to our room instead of waiting as it was quite late.\n\nAfter some more deliberation that night, I decided that rather than staying an extra night in the hotel, I would just spend the evening after the funeral with my family and drive home that same night. In the morning, I spoke with the man at the front desk (different from the night before) and explained that I had booked my room for a second night, which I would no longer be needing. He said he would cancel it. Again, the computer was being \""very slow\"" and would not let him access my account right away. He assured me that he would check me out for that night and I could leave, as I was on my way to the funeral at the time. I checked out (or so I thought) and returned my room keys to him.\n\nWhen I got my credit card statement a couple of weeks later, I was surprised to see that I had been charged for two nights instead of one. I immediately called the hotel, to explain the situation. The man who picked up was extremely unprofessional, saying something like \""hold on I am on the other line. Can you call back in 5 minutes? Bye.\"" No greeting, no please or thank you, he didn't even say the name of the hotel. Anyway, I call back and explained the situation, and I am assured it will be taken care of. To make a long story shorter, I ended up calling this hotel 5-6 times over a MONTH with the same \""we'll get back to you, we're working on it, someone will call you...\"" on and on and nothing ever came of it. I never even got one apology either. Then, their tone completely changed, and they began blaming the situation on me. The last time I spoke to someone at this hotel, he accused me of staying two nights, because \""the maid said there was a \""do not disturb\"" sign on the door the next day, so our stuff was still in there, so we stayed two days\"" and outright accused me of lying. First of all, we did not even have a \""do not disturb\"" sign in our room, because I wanted one and looked for it and it didn't exist. Secondly, we packed all of our things into our car by 10AM so the room was empty. And thirdly I had a receipt from the hotel clearly stating I stayed for one night with the date and time I checked out. He started yelling at me and when I said I was going to report them to head office, he screamed something along the lines of \""go ahead!\"" and hung up on me. \n\nTo this day, I am completely flabbergasted by the lack of service I received at this hotel.

He asked if the second floor was ok with our pet and I agreed it was fine.

Right before we fell asleep we heard running water so I checked the bathroom and neither the toilet or shower was running.  I determined it was the pipes in the ceiling, so we just closed the door to the bathroom and we could barely hear it overnight.  The tub surround seemed to be brand new, which was nice, but it looked like there may have been some soap scum or mold near the washrag rack.\n\nOverall the stay was average.  Clean and comfortable but we were a little concerned that nobody was at the front desk when we arrived (though I completely understand that he must have been the only person on duty and had other things to do.  They should probably put a camera and monitor in the laundry room so the staff can see what's going on).

My fianc\u00E9 and I went out and arrived back at 1am, when our cab dropped us off there were bottles being smashed just outside the door and I saw multiple drunk people being carried to their rooms which was a really classy scene. The party was still going on when we got to our room and we told the front desk, of course when they had gotten up there the party was smart enough to quite down. I also asked about a late check out and was informed that they could possibly do a noon check out.

The gym is spotless.  When you see the treadmills you will thank me.  The breakfast is better than most restaurants and they have a cocktail hour with complementary drinks from quality wines to three types of beer.  And the spread is real food. I personally recommend any corner unit, city view.  You get a full view of Richmond row, and the sunrise is priceless.

The rate quoted for walk-in seemed reasonable ($65 plus taxes) and we asked to see a room (which was clean and smelled fine) before registering.  The room we were first given had not been cleaned, so we went back to the front desk and were given another. (Suggestion to mgmt:  We're pretty easy going, but others might be bothered by being assigned an uncleaned room, so accurate record keeping is an opportunity for improvement.)\n\nIt was late and we were hungry.  With friends we went to the Tony Roma's around the corner upon the suggestion of the desk clerk.  Food was good, even found some veg choices.  There's also a Mediterranean restaurant adjacent to the hotel, which we only noticed the next day.  Anyone tried that?\n\nFree breakfast was at the adjacent Southside Family Restaurant.  What you get was OK (as a veg-o, I simply asked them to leave off the bacon).  I like a big breakfast, so ordered pancakes on my own dollar, and they were fairly good.\n\nI prefer a slightly firmer bed, but my wife and I slept well enough.",4,positive

Right now, it is a nice hotel, especially for a Motel 6, but we encountered some issues that suggest that maintenance may be declining as a priority.  Check-in took a while; they were trying to verify that the room I was assigned was ready, because of a late checkout.  The friendly desk clerk directed me to a drug store down the road that would be open (It was Labor Day), but it was closed.  Our room was clean and comfortable, but there were maintenance issues.  One bedside lamp would not work; fast detective work revealed that it was not plugged in and there was no place that the cord would reach to plug it in.  The desk clerk came up promptly, reassigned a critical extension cord, and with my help, ran it to the lamp in question.  The shower head was newly installed and leaked - sprayed a fine mist over the shower curtain onto the bathroom floor.  Potentially dangerous!  The furniture is more Holiday Inn than Motel 6, but very old and severely scratched.  The carpet was cleaned, but had several old stains; it was stained and ripped in hallways. \n A spa tub with the pool was a pleasant surprise - not on the listing -  but the pool area is very spartan (few chairs) and dark.  There was no hamper for towels, so people had been leaving them on the deck, in the elevator, even in a trash can.  The neighborhood is fine - in a commercial strip with many other hotels and chain restaurants, reasonably convenient to downtown and the expressway.\n\nIf they get hold of these maintenance issues promptly, they'll have a nice place - well worth the cost.  If not, the place will go downhill quickly.  Check RECENT reviews!",3,negative

At around midnight, the guests in the next room arrived with a young girl and jumped up and down and laughed till 1 a.m.  There is little to no insulation in the walls it seems as we could make out their conversation.  We got little sleep even with ear plugs.  The next morning, we went out for breakfast.  There is a coffee machine in the lobby but none in the room.  There is no decaf either...just your regular motel coffee.  There are no tissues in the room either so get ready to wipe whatever it is you have to wipe with toilet paper only!  When we returned at 3 in the afternoon, our room was still not made up.  We wanted to use the pool and shower afterward so my husband went to the housekeeper and asked for fresh towels.  She gladly gave him two.  We went to the pool for approximately an hour.  The pool is quiet and although small, served its purpose.  It is a salt-water pool.  The hot-tub is warm at best so don't be fooled by its appearance...you will not be soothing any muscles in that tub!  When we returned to our room, it had not been cleaned.  My husband went to the front desk and asked the receptionist why our room had not been cleaned.  He said that the housekeeper went home for the day.  She figured that two towels were all we needed and went home!  My husband told him we will never be back again.  Very disappointed.  I was looking forward to a much better experience.  If you can stay somewhere else...do so.",1,negative

But staff assured me they have a policy on travel teams that cause problems and that they would not be welcome @ Motel 6 again. Nothing worse than trying to sleep or relax with kids running wild around the motel. I felt most sorry for the long haul trucker who by law must sleep and was having the most difficult time with the travel team noise. Do they not realize they are bothering others?

I chose it because I needed somewhere low cost for 4 nights (in between helping my daughter move apartments) that was also pet friendly (my daughter has a cat). There was no charge for the cat - some other \""pet friendly\"" hotels wanted a pet fee of $50-$100 per night!\n\nWe had a non-smoking room with 2 queen beds, a fridge and a microwave. The room seemed ok at first but eventually the cat found an old, used tampon somewhere in the room. The window wouldn't open, the frame was broken and there were loose screws. Beds were slightly uncomfortable and there were metal bed frame pieces jutting out from the sides that you could hurt an ankle on. Apart from that, everything seemed clean, functional and perfectly adequate for the price (I got a discount through an employer perk). Wifi was good and there was a desk I could work at. Bathroom had towels and soap but no extras like shampoo. Shower pressure was decent. It was one of those rooms with connecting doors to the room next door. I dislike those but thankfully the next door neighbours were quiet. There were also smoking rooms nearby but I don't recall ever smelling cigarette smoke although my sense of smell is poor - my daughter thought she could smell weed one time. Mostly I saw people smoking outside the front door. \n\nTo cut a long story short, it gradually became apparent that a prostitute was operating out of room 409. Lots of loud sex at all hours, multiples daily baths and a string of male visitors over the 4 days\u002Fnights we stayed there. When checking out, I asked the lady at the front desk if they ever watched their security footage (there's a large screen with a feed from multiple cameras). She said they did. I asked if they knew they likely had a prostitute operating out of room 409. She responded that they just rent rooms - what guests do while in their rooms is not their concern. She did not seem to be surprised so I suspect that they already knew what was going on. I found this attitude very surprising and I suggested that if they were going to allow a prostitute to operate out of a room then maybe they shouldn't place other guests in neighbouring rooms.",2,negative

I have to say we had no issues or problems with our 1-night stay last night. I admit to having the idea that a Motel 6 was not a desirable choice, but we knew this to be a relatively new property, it is pet-friendly (still a challenge that the number of available choices always goes waaaaay down when you look for a pet-friendly option), and the price was good, $69.99 plus tax. We decided to try this Motel 6. We have NO regrets about it. Our room was large, spotlessly clean, and very quiet, even though it looked towards the parking lot and the hotel itself is quite close to Exeter Road. The room d\u00E9cor is pretty modest, nothing fancy, but also all in good condition. Our double-queen room had a small refrigerator and a microwave. The bathroom amenities were good quality. A ground floor room was perfect for us with the dog. The hotel has an indoor, saltwater pool -- we're not big pool people, but I could see that it was being used by what looked like perfectly average folks to me. The flat-screen TV monitor was a good size and the free WiFi strength was excellent. The exterior of the property was tidy and well-lit, so I was not concerned when walking the dog at night. I would suggest the hotel put up a poop-bag station -- it's obvious that some dog owners are not taking responsibility for their pets.

Three garbage cans  (2 regular, one recycling).  There were two elevators so there was minimal waiting.  There is plentiful coffee in the lobby in the morning with real cream (not creamer).  There is a rack of tourist brochures in the lobby.\n\nCarpet is old and should be replaced but it wasn't \""gross\"".  The key-cards to the room didn't work after three tries at activation.  It turned out the electronic system was on the fritz and they had to call the technician to fix it and then had to reprogram all the doors.  This was all done while we were out so it wasn't a big problem for us although it was big work for the front desk staff.\n\nFront desk staff was very courteous and helpful, but there was only one person on the front desk at night and no housekeeping staff at all to address any cleaning problems (not that we had any but someone had a room with no clean towels at 10 pm).  The desk person did the best she could under the circumstances and was very polite in spite of an angry customer.\n\nThe heating system worked well - you could set the thermostat and it responded promptly.  Curtains darkened the room well.  I didn't hear any outside noise (the window was shut).  Bed was comfortable and the pillows were fine.\n\nThere is no restaurant at the motel but there are several nearby (a two minute walk if that).  I did not even look at the pool so can't comment on it; it is indoors.\n\nOverall, the 4-day stay was fine but I thought the price was a bit high for the amenities.  Motel 6 in Mississauga is only $59 and we paid more like $100 per night.  Some had paid $75 (they booked a year in advance).",3,negative

data/ca/154995/3640910/546489566.html,Courtyard London,"""As a long-time Marriott booster (and an Elite Platinum member), we anticipated a pleasant stay at this Courtyard, after a long, arduous drive to the city to visit with an in-law recovering from recent hospital surgery. Where we expected this hotel to be an 'oasis' from the stressful family situation, what we endured was entirely the opposite!\n\nOn Check-In: After our 4.5 hour drive, we hoped to be able to check-in quickly (at or about 3:00 pm) so we could attend to priority planning matters ahead of dinner with the in-laws. Where it should have been straight-forward checking us it, we arrived to a crowd of 'hockey-families' all looking to secure their rooms (on the 4th floor, preferred, we were advised), and as a result, we faced an unexpected delay. While aware that 4:00 pm is the guaranteed check-in time, it's a rare occurence (in our experience as Platinum members) that a hotel is unable to accommodate us immediately on arrival, particularly on a weekend, in a small market setting. \n\nWe were advised that 'the' room selected for us (on the 5th floor, well away from the hockey families...we were told), was not yet ready for us to occupy. Yet all around us, we watched 'hockey families' being welcomed and processed, while we were told we'd have to wait for at least 10 minutes (time we really didn't have to waste, given our other 'planned' commitment). Assuming the room would be worth the wait, and advised we would be in an area of the hotel, well away from 'hockey families', we resigned ourselves to the situation...left our luggage with the harried staff member at the front desk, and departed to run our errands; even though it meant my spouse would not have enough time to return to the hotel to freshen up, prior to our dinner commitment.\n\nUpon returning to the hotel to try 'checking in' a second time (after 4:00 pm), I found the lobby further overrun by 'hockey families' - boisterous and insensitive to anyone around them not involved in the 'hockey culture' - attempting to also secure their rooms. It did not help that the two families in line ahead of me were being advised that the hotel did not have their reservation, nor could they be accommodated on the 'all-important' 4th floor where the other 'hockey families' were being placed. This haggling resulted in my losing another 15-20 minutes while waiting to pick up our room key and stored luggage. Suffice it to say, I advised the desk clerk that this level was service was creating real stress for us, and that we were not impressed.\n\nReceiving the key (finally), I was consoled by the fact that we were advised our room would be located well away from the 'hockey family chaos' unfolding all around us in the lobby area (this group effectively 'took over' all the public areas that might have been available for use by other guests with little to no interest in hockey. Alas, it was not to be.\n\nArriving on the 5th floor (not the 4th floor where the hockey families were to be located) and heading to the room, I faced a flurry of unsupervised children scrambling around the elevator lobby, checking out ice machines, stomping up and down and hallway and generally make enthusiastic nuisances of themselves (I don't blame the kids per se, they no doubt had to endure long drives as well). For me, the issue was, that despite being held back from early check-in, we still found ourselves placed right in the middle of a room cluster where we were surrounded 'on all sides' by noisy 'hockey families' with no particular awareness that there were other 'unassociated' guests staying in the building. This was disappointing to several reasons, not the least of which was that I was unable to get my work done in-room, due to the general sense of disorder and noise in the hallway (again, in an area where I was advised we'd been 'well away' from the hockey families). I find the deception and deceit unacceptable. It would have been preferrable if we had been advised 'in advance' that the place would be overrun by the athletic assemblage, so we could make other arrangements. We were extended no such courtesy.\n\nOn the assigned Room: Given that we were advised 'on arrival' that our room had been chosen for us, well away from the 'hockey families', I made the erroneous assumption that it might be worth waiting for. Alas, our expectation was dashed, as the room was very badly designed and inconsistent with the qualify of Courtyard rooms experienced in other cities. It was no better than the Towne Place rooms that we have also frequented in the recent past (must have been the same architect) because the rooms simply 'don't work'. Marriott used to state that 'when you're comfortable, you can do anything'. We appreciated that sentiment, and generally we've found it to be true for our travel needs. However, the room assigned to us on this occasion left us highly 'uncomfortable' and thus, unable to get much done. The computer desk area is highly constrained, at the foot of the bed, crammed into a very small (perhaps 1\u002F3 of the room) space. As a result, the desk chair blocks access around the bed, and can't be easily moved around due to space limitations. The door to the bathroom is too large for the entrance and interior space, blocking ready access to the toilet, the window in the bed area doesn't open; guests are forced to use the 'in-room' hvac machine for any ventilation at all, which operates noisily. As a result, we chose not to turn it on (preferring the room to be quiet). However, it didn't much matter, given the slamming of hallway doors, running feet and conversations taking place, well into the night, by clusters of 'hockey dads' sharing stories over bottles of wine. Again, while we don't begrudge them their enjoyment (our nephew plays in the AHL), a little more sensitivity to those of us not involved in the tournament would have been welcomed.  We would have much preferred a room that was more 'open concept' like the one pictured in the promotional material with a soaker-tub, but this wasn't offered as an option.\n\nOn Check-Out: Adding to the confusion, we received email notification after the 'first night' thanking us for our recent stay (we were still only half way through it!), and having the account closed mid-visit. This morning, we received a second statement (under our door, thankfully) that suggested we were being charged for two nights (the first night...a second time, plus our final night). This required further conversation with the harried desk clerk to ensure a full understanding of the statement entries, which are presented in a fashion that is not-at-all clear. He was helpful and advised that the errors had been corrected; I await my credit-card statement with interest, as my confidence in the management at this property has been severely eroded.\n\nOn Breakfast Service: One bright light was the pleasant breakfast included for us this morning. I don't know why it wasn't provided for both mornings (we only received coupons for use for one breakfast which is inconsistent with our understanding of our Platinum Member benefits). The breakfast was presented as ordered by a pleasant (but again, harried) staff member, due to staffing shortages they were facing -- which was unfortunate for them (and for guests), given the large number of 'hockey families' seeking breakfast service and check-out assistance, given (likely) constrained timelines to get to the arena. All in all, this hotel seemed to be having real difficulty managing the crowd; and for those of us not associated, the entire experience was unsatisfactory. \n\nThis is not the level of service we've come to expect at Marriott; and we hope that management will take this all under advisement to review their systems and processes to address what appears to be some serious staff training, and operational practices.\n\nFor any prospective Marriott Platinum members thinking of staying at this property on a weekend, our advice is to 'steer well clear'...there are better options nearby, including the 4 Points Sheraton, located just around the corner.",1,negative

We didn't get a restful sleep.  Unfortunately, our son was lethargic the next morning and maybe this even affected his play that day.  The hotel is very dated... like it's stuck in the 1980's.

It is located on top of a hill, in a beautiful and quiet location, right on the Thames River in London, ON.  The Guest House is very reasonably priced; the rooms come with or without showers; and the entire complex is close to the local hospital, Western University, a large mall and shopping area, and downtown London.  Yet, it is very, very quiet and private.  Each room is very clean, a bit sparse, but most have chairs and tables.  The rooms are simple with comfortable beds, and every room has a balcony.  If you have ever wondered what it was like to be in a nunnery - here is your chance for the experience!  The Guest House is run by some of the nicest and friendliest people on the planet, and they will do everything they can to insure you have a good stay.  The prices are reasonable due to the fact that many hotel-chain extras are lacking - but who needs shampoo?  The Guest House provides soap and clean towels; there is a kitchen facility available for guest use on each floor; there is a TV room for socializing on each floor too - although each room has its own TV; and everything is very clean.  Ask for an attached toilet, and if you are staying longer, a shower is nice too although the shared shower facilities are also very clean and private.  The Guest House was a fantastic find for me when I had to stay in London several times a week over a period of time, and I would recommend it without hesitation.  The people there made me feel welcomed, and I looked forward to spending the night in my room - many thanks to all of you there!  Especial thanks to Brianne and Cassandra who remembered me and always made me feel special!

All rooms are off one hall, where the public washrooms and common rooms are also located (more about these later). \n\nOur room was DIRTY: the carpet was lined with dustballs, other scraps, and an half-inch of dust where the vacuum can't meet the walls. Bits of string, tape, gum wrappers were found in the closet. The screen in the bedroom window was hanging lopsided when we entered. When we turned down our bed we found black hair from either a) previous occupant or b) housekeeper. The lower sheets were wrinkled (by use?). We folded up a towel and placed it between the mattress and footboard to stop it from creaking. The door auto locks, and since it slams shut behind you whenever you leave the room, you often find yourself locked out! With only one key per room, you have to orchestrate your comings and goings if you are travelling with a roommate. No clock, no phone, no hairdryer, no tv, no microwave in the room (will be charged extra for these). No blackout curtains.\n\nYour balcony is shared with the people in the room next to yours. We found empty pop cans on our balcony even though the room beside ours was unoccupied. There was nothing on the balcony (no lounge chairs or tables). \n\nIt is very noisy: no sound proofing around doors, all doors slam heavily  (including the public washrooms so every time someone takes a midnight visit you hear it). The common room (where there's a large tv), kitchen, and dining areas do not have doors so you hear everything going on there (someone was throwing a party with a cake when we checked in). There is a public telephone in the same corridor where the rooms are that you can hear when in use. A woman was talking for over an hour and we heard her conversation as we lay in our bed!  \n\nWe paid more for a half bath and were glad that there were no occupants in the adjoining room as the toilet flushes like those on an airplane! There was sticky soap residue in the soap holder with a packaged soap placed on top (gross). We discovered that the door of our shared half bath allows one direct access to the adjoining guest room! Not safe!\n\nThe public bathrooms are in the central corridor and have two regular showers (with curtains) and a third shower for the disabled. The shower tiles were soap scummy and the floors sticky. The ceilings are peeling with 3-inch pieces of paint curling off above your head. The \""disabled\"" shower area has no safety grab bars and one must step into a tub in order to use the shower (so not quite suitable for the disabled!).  But it was cleaner than the regular showers.\n\nTo sum up, this was the worst place in which we have ever stayed. We have stayed in Italian nunneries where they only have cold water and threadbare towels! But they were clean! This place was filthy. The poor layout, lack of basic soundproofing, open common rooms, central public telephone, automatic slamming doors, also make it a very difficult place to sleep.

Very quiet with well manicured grounds surrounded by forest with access to walking paths with a feel for being in the English countryside. The restaurant has a very nice quiet patio and view \u2013 excellent for a drink with friends (We couldn't decide on which white wine to order and our server brought us too tasting glasses to help us - it was a very nice touch). Rooms are comfortable. At the front desk Shannon went out of her way to get me the best info on the trail system and Cole also. \n\nI have a \u201Chalf\u201D reservation about the Asher\u2019s dining room at the Ivey Spencer Leadership Center.  The buffet breakfast (if you go at the start) is one of the best served in Ontario. The food was hot, well presented with a wide and delicious assortment.\n\nHowever, for dinner or supper I would pass. My two companions went for the buffet (we had arrived about 1 hour after it started) but upon entering and seeing no one at the carving station \u2013 just pieces of previously sliced roast beef; I passed and went for a Philly beef baguette hoping it would be fresher.\n\nThe buffet dinner that my companions got \u2013 the roast beef was less than warm and with bits of unpleasant gristle in it. In other words - a poor select piece of meat or someone who doesn\u2019t know how to select cuts of meat. There was something called the cottage pie (I think).  Supposedly, a version of a Shepards pie but appeared to be made of ingredients of unknown origin (It certainly got left on their plates).  As I said we arrived just over an hour into the start of the buffet so that may have contributed to the overall favour of the meal but none of the food was hot - lukewarm - to even cool at best.  However, they did both say that the desserts presented were very good. \nAs for my Philly sandwich, it was by far the worst that I have had. It read well on the menu but it arrived as one gooey mess on my plate. The meat seemed like chopped up buffet leftovers from the night before.  It was so gooey it turned the baguette soggy from the melted cheese and was difficult to pick up.  If there was any green pepper, onion etc., it wasn\u2019t discernable.\n\nAs I said the breakfast buffet was admirable but the dinner buffet showed no pride \u2013 i.e. a great lack of care by the kitchen. I enjoyed having the pool table set next to the dining room but the hors d\u2019oeuvres Asher\u2019s talks about were bowls of stale potato chips put out on the tables and seemed collected from previous nights or other more distant era. \nI cannot recommend either the dinner buffet or the dinner menu which seemed limited enough that you would have thought the kitchen capable of producing each item on it somewhat tasty enough level.\n\nIf Asher\u2019s wants to say they \u201Cpride\u201D themselves on selecting good local ingredients then they might want to rethink their game plan.\n",4,positive

The shower enclosure had a considerable amount of very visible mildew all around the bottom edge. This is an indication of poor maintenance.

The grounds and gardens around the building were beautiful. \n\nThe room: I had a standard room with a queen bed.The room was pretty small but that was okay, and although it seemed clean, the room was musty at first, like they haven't used that room in a while. The bathroom is gorgeous. It had a big shower. Tip: bring your own toiletries, they attempt to provide shampoo and soap through dispensers on the wall, but they were not full\u002Fnot working. Not a luxury room, but was what I expected for the price I paid. \n\nThe food: We had a buffet breakfast every morning included in our four night stay.

Our room was smallish, but the appointments were top-notch and the on-line price deal with free breakfast made it even better. The bed and pillows were very comfortable and the black-out drapes made for a very good night's sleep. Our summer package included a free breakfast - not a continental or buffet type breakfast, but a fully plated breakfast from the menu. My wife had the sunrise breakfast sandwich with hash browns, fruit, orange juice & coffee. I had fresh blueberry & pecan pancakes with bacon, hash browns, fruit, juice & coffee. Both were delicious.

All meals- breakfast, lunch, and dinner were extremely enjoyable- and as a healthy eater I was impressed by the numerous healthy options available.  A full breakfast buffet spread offered everything from eggs and bacon, to 4 different types of breakfast sausage, fruit, cheeses, potatoes, yogurt, granola etc. Lunch was also fantastic with options ranging from pastas and chicken dishes, to spinach salads, and fresh homemade soups.

A springy rock.  If you like sleeping on cheap mattresses - this is the place for you! \nThe hallways in the newer wing were tired, dated, and dimly lit.  Low ceilings and fluorescent lighting really didn't fit with my expectations. \nThere are excessive amounts of doors leading to rooms - okay - maybe just one extra set.  But when you are hauling luggage, every door counts and these ones didn't have the automatic open buttons to assist (this also may be problematic for anyone with mobility issues). \nAt one point the door to a laundry area was open and that looked just horrifying.  I am not sure if it was for guests or housekeeping but either way, it was like a second floor basement. \nThe rooms were small.  I guess I am used to staying in hotels where there are two double\u002Fqueen beds or one king and lots of floor space but these rooms were cramped.  When you enter, the ceiling is quite low (though it opens up).  There isn't enough room for two nightstands even, rather a desk serves as the second nightstand.  Okay for one small person but if I was larger\u002Ftaller, I imagine it would have felt uncomfortable.  The bathroom was also cramped with the door essentially swinging open into the toilet.  \n\nAll of this however was forgivable and would have just resulted in a \""meh\"" experience.  Not bad but not amazing. \n\nHowever, housekeeping more than nailed the coffin closed on this place!  It was the hair.  Dark hair.  Someone's hair was everywhere.  And though it wasn't screaming infidelities, it was grossing me right out.  First it was on the bathroom counter.  It was dark and short.  My hair is light and long.  This hair was not mine.  Housekeeping clearly had not wiped down the counter, and if they did they really half-[--] it.  I was tired though and I thought, one hair, whatever.  I wiped it into the garbage, washed my paranoid hands thoroughly, and then left my belongings in a different area so that housekeeping would hopefully clean the counter. Sadly, this was not the end of the hair.  The next night, while re-arranging my pillows I noticed that the backs of them were covered in black fluff and stray hairs.  Not one, but many.  So many hairs.  I threw all the pillows on the ground and kept the one that was least hairy.   I believe the problem here likely came from their dryers.  I feel like it was a result of static cling and a poor laundry system, or at least I hoped as that would mean the hairs were at a minimum laundered.   My coworker who was also staying in the hotel had the same problem, finding stray hairs all over her bathroom as well.   In the shower, on the counter.  Hair, hair, everywhere. \n\nThe one thing I really expect from a hotel is that my room is clean.  Not just a quick wipe down like I do when I clean my house, but the kind of clean that removes the grime of strangers who came before so that guests can sleep peacefully as if it is their own home.  I really don't think that is asking a lot, but these days it seems so hard to find a place where the housekeepers actually care enough to properly clean the rooms.  \n\nSome of the negatives with this place are hard to fix and wouldn't have stopped me from staying again with this hotel but the housekeeping was just not acceptable.  Hair stands out, its a good indicator of how clean a place is and it begs the question, if they missed a visible hair, what invisible grime is still lurking?",2,negative

Simple rooms, nothing fancy, simple building, rather small... and I was tempted to ask my wife: \""What is it that made people rate this place as one of the highest rated hotels in London, Ontario?\""  \nNevertheless, we checked in, and got our room on the third floor. Our room is rather tiny, nothing to talk about at home... There is a fridge in the room, but nothing in it!  We felt like drinking a glass of water... but no water in the room!  Nothing!  The fridge is empty.  Had to go out of the room, and find the water at the end of the hallway, just cups and a water filling bottle, you know that 20 liter bottle that's upside down, and you can choose from room temperature and ice cold.  I felt I had to wash the glasses too, they were not disposable ones.  \nI managed to kill a couple of bugs in our room on the wall.\nWell, considering that the room costs almost $200, I had to compare it to one of the nicer hotels we stayed in recently, so I mentioned it to my wife: \""This is $200, the Trump Toronto is $600 a night, what's the difference?  Is the Trump Hotel 3 times better?  Looking at the size of the room with absolutely no extras here and looking at the Trump room... well, the Trump room is about 1,000 square feet, this one is about 250 to 300 square feet.  So the Trump Hotel room is about 3 times the size of this (or larger), so is it worth $200?  I think NOT!  I think this room should have cost about $120 at the best.\""\nCoffee in the morning is self-serve, again, I washed the cup, not disposable.  I opted to drive to a Tim Horton's rather, at least they serve you with everything in it.  Whew!  What a relief!  LOL!\nThe property itself is nice, lovely grounds, but, like I said, this \""hotel\"" rather reminds me or a motel-rated place that we were taken to on class trips when I was a teenager.  Much too simple.\nI truly hope the breakfast will be decent.  \nThis is not a hotel I want to return to.  Maybe I can use their conference facilities for my companies, the conference rooms look to be more impressive from what I could see through the locked glass doors. \nThis hotel certainly appeared much more welcoming and more luxurious than what it really is.  Don't get me wrong, it is not truly bad at all, but it's simply as simple as it can get.  If you book a $40 motel, that would be about the same as this, except here you pay close to $200 -- probably you are paying for their ground maintenance, there must be several dozens of nicely maintained acres of lawn, it is nice... but we didn't pay to look at the grounds...  \nThe quality of the bed is super simple, every time my wife moved in her sleep, I woke up.

Although I'm sure the room was actually clean, it was old and dated and the floor was covered in stains. The bathtub was constantly leaking, everything that was supposed to be white is now yellowed from age.  Next door is a billiards bar and their customers were constantly outside smoking pot and the odour drifted into any rooms facing on that side.  The parking lot constantly smelled of it.  We were sadly disappointed in the place, very old, and more expensive than other hotels in the area that we have stayed at in the past, but because of a baseketball tournament in town all the other hotels were booked solid. We did appreciate the concierge putting us in a room far away from the teenage basketball teams at least, so that was nice.  And the staff were friendly. I rated the service as poor due to checking in to our room 2 hours late, the staff themselves were really pleasant.  We wouldn't stay here again, the value for the money is not there.

Upon registering I was given the option for a free room upgrade if I wanted to join their rewards program.\n\nOne big down point is there is only one elevator and it is not located centrally where it should be.  The elevator is located on the south east end of the hotel so plan on using stairs unless you request a room near elevator.\n\nMy room was at north west end of the hotel so i had to use the stairs up to third floor but I was able to park very close to a door.

Great thing was my room was clean and fresh smelling without a hint of cigarette smell.  The room is very large and has a homey comfortable feel.  It also shows signs of age but was clean.

In the living area there also was a table, small sink, microwave, and small fridge.

The security was very strict with no one making noise in the hallways, so it was nice to have a separate living area in which some parents could gather.\n\nThe hotel itself is not newly decorated, but everything was very clean.

data/ca/154995/182897/121626527.html,Quality Suites London,"""Let's start with the bad. The interior is a little dated - early 90s maybe. The parking lot is a little awkward for cars and pedestrians when cars are reversing and exiting, and the ice and snow has wreaked havoc with the surface, leaving potholes and unevenness. The lobby is hard to find at first - it is kind of unassuming and not well posted by signs. The drop off point is a tow away zone, and the dropped curb doesn't really \""work\"" for reaching the front door - you have to negotiate around brick columns first. It seems like the needs of disabled access was something of an afterthought. \n\nThe rather odd layout with 100m long corridors can encourage younger occupants to run up and down (the hotel seems to be popular with junior hockey teams who are chaperoned by just a couple of adults  who may be accommodated on a different floor level), and the sound does travel when they do that. Weekends can be so busy you can't sit down for breakfast and sometimes they run out of crockery and cutlery. This is mainly because rooms have mini kitchenettes in them, but don't provide any utensils, so people take plates and cups and cutlery from the breakfast room and leave the hotel to use paper plates and plastic cutlery - not very environmentally friendly. The hotel has a small pay-to-use laundry.\n\nThe area around the hotel is still not very conducive to pedestrians even though a huge number of hotels are now in the area, the City planners must assume everyone has a car and uses one for even the short trip to WalMart across the street as it is mostly without sidewalks and pedestrian shortcuts - you have to dodge parking lot and road traffic virtually the whole way. For fresh fruit and veggies the nearest store is about a 20-minute walk or 5 min drive away, along Bradley Ave west. \n\nThe good. The staff seem happy in their work and motivated. This includes the maids, who are delightful and very attentive to detail. For longer term stays (month to month) the hotel offers unbeatable and excellent value - way better than renting, furnishing, powering and heating an apartment. Daily maid service (once a week change of bed linens) and breakfast included, plus you can have mail delivered, you just cannot beat the price if you are new in the City and need a home for a while. Just call and ask for their monthly rate you will be surprised. The rooms are a good size and furnished well enough - King beds seem to be standard in most rooms. It is nice to have a bedroom separate from the living\u002Feating area, each with a TV, something you don't often find in this price point. They have a pet policy too for those with dogs.",4,positive

When we pulled up, there were employees smoking right outside in front of arriving customers. Yes, this is what we want to see upon arriving!! As soon as you walk in, the smell of cigarette smoke is extremely overwhelming! My friend arrived 2 hours later and complained to front desk of the cigarette smell and was informed that a prior guest that checked in smelled of smoke. That is a complete lie! It smelled of cigarette smoke the entire time we were there. Obvious that they smoke in the building when no one is around. There needs to be a surprise visit to this place from head office!!!\nWhile my friend was checking in, I was with her and happened to look up above the check in area. There is a grate on the wall that had so much dust on it that the dust looked like it was multiplying!\nThe halls are so dark and gloomy that my daughter said it looked like a haunted house.\nEvery single piece of carpet in that place needs to be changed!  BIG STAINS everywhere and I mean everywhere. DON'T TAKE YOUR SHOES OFF EVER! The bedding had holes in it! Smelled musty in the room. Mold on the floor in the bathroom.\nThe worst thing was when my friend's daughter said mom there are stains on the toilet seat and her mom said oh honey it is probably just discoloured, then proceeded to take a wet towel and wipe across it.

The management said sorry we only have 2 cleaning ladies for the whole hotel and then gave them another room on the same floor as us. So only having 2 cleaning ladies justifies that they skip cleaning parts just to keep on schedule?? The next day we asked for 2 extra towels, we were told NO that the amount that is in there is what we get!\nThe wifi didn't work. The Tv was a big box tv from 1980 that had lines running through it.\nOur view was a garbage disposal. We parked on the opposite side of the entrance and walking up to the door to get in, there must have been about 100 cigarette butts on the ground just on the sidewalk before the steps. There was rusted metal everywhere. \nThe staff should be checking the grounds everyday at least 3 times to clean up the cigarette butts.\nThis hotel is very very very disgusting and I am extremely angry that we even paid a penny to stay here.

We were joined by our London friends and walked to a nearby restaurant (Tony Romas) for dinner.\nThe hotel has king size beds in the suites, great sleeping, and of course 2 tv's because it is a suite so you can watch 2 different shows if you don't agree!\nI was a little surprised that the room did not have a fridge, since it had a microwave oven, but it did have a locked microbar for which we were not given a key;  maybe it was a fridge as well, and we were in a suite which could be adjoining and open to another suite, so maybe the fridge was in there.  Not a problem for us, we didn't need it.\nThe free (included) breakfast was typical of most hotels like this, could be made better by the addition of a couple of hot items, but the person working there was most pleasant.\nWe will certainly look at this hotel again for our future visits to London.",4,positive

Within walking distance is a mall and several eateries.  My room and the hotel itself was clean - no visible mold in the bathroom, beds had a tidy appearance with no stains, there were no unusual odours.and the room and hotel was tidy.  The room itself has the prototypical chain hotel room layout.  Some of the decor seems to be getting a little older and the TVs certainly will have to be upgraded to keep pace with other similar type hotels.  The bed I had was not too comfortable.  When checking in, my business colleagues did receive pleasant enough service, but we did not have adjoining rooms which was a little aggravating.  We did ask and were told this could not be accommodated (we did make the reservations a week in advance and the hotel was far from being fully booked).  The breakfast offered was slightly less than the usual continental breakfast, but was still sufficient (3 types of cereal, pastries, bagels, juice, fruit).  The price was less than $100 per night which seems right.  It is noted that I was here for a conference, and the room where we met had no heat.  Being very cold outside, we had to sit in our winter jackets.  Apparently no heat had been used in that room all year.  The conditions of this room should certainly have been checked out by hotel staff in advance.",3,negative

I went back and the manager quickly apologized and remedied the problem. The next room was super clean and quiet. I loved the French doors to the bedroom and the spacey living area. Didn't spend as much time there as I attended a comedy show and hung out at the Western Fair and a karaoke bar afterwards and got in very late but returned to a cozy bed and had a nice hot shower the next morning. \n\nAlso very impressed with the breakfast bar and its HUGE variety of choices.

Service was excellent provided by an old school front desk manager (Maurice) who was simply great. The corridors are a little worn but everything is in good condition. For those on a budget, rooms a re little more than half of what they were when the property was new so it is a bargain.

The lady (I think her name was Carol) who works at the breakfast counter was rude, not what you want first thing in the morning, but the guy who worked at breakfast was a very friendly fellow.\n\nI think the only thing that really bothered us is that we got a small room with two very uncomfortable spring form mattress beds (I didn't even know they still made them) that gave us back aches for the same price as the suites with so much more room!  We should have been charged less for a smaller room.  \n\nI would stay here again for a tournament, but if I had a choice I would stay at a nicer hotel for the same amount we paid here.

I must say that this has been the dirtiest hotel that I have ever stayed at. The hallway smelled like body odor and carpets were filthy, once we reached the staircase it looked as though they are rarely mopped it. We had a suite and it was no different, it smelled like a damp basement, the carpet was gross with stains, the air ducts were full of dirt, there were spider webs in almost every corner, the sheets were worn and thin, the pillows were below the standard size, there were no extra blankets, and the hair drier was melted. As for the free breakfast, that was pretty standard however good luck finding the hot water for the tea bags that are placed next to the coffee pot and if you are wanting coffee you better get up early because there is only one pot and if it's empty it takes forever for them to refill it. The eating area is a joke for a family of four or more. There are only three tables that seat four and about four tables that seat two. The hotel was sold out and families were sitting on the floor to eat, the line for breakfast went out the door and down the hallway, and there were no accommodations for little ones (no booster seats or high chairs). I would have moved to a different hotel but all the hotels were sold out due to a big event in the area. Be warned... I stayed in a suite, designed for business men and women...a normal room maybe even worse.\nOn the flip side of things, the front desk personnel were very friendly and knowledgeable of the area.

Second, the suite was newly-appointed and very clean with a large desk and executive chair in the sitting room, a king size bed and two good-sized televisions (one in the sitting room and one in the bedroom).  Third, the free continential breakfast was offered in a very nice and clean dining room and was all-you-can-eat cereal, muffins, toast, yogourt, etc.  Finally, as I checked in using a \""Choice Club\"" membership card, I was able to get a 3:00 p.m. checkout arranged through the cheerful desk clerk.  At a price of $95 per night, this was a very good place to stay.  I will be going to London a number of times over the next few months and will be staying here each time.\n",5,positive

If you are handicapped, call this hotel first. The room I saw would not make me happy (and they only have one handicap room and it is on the 2nd floor).  The shower is roll-in but small and for some inexplicable reason there is a shower head, not a hand-held unit. There is NO built-in chair, only a stool. The bathroom is a fairly good size though.  Handicap bars appear smallish to me -not the usual large\u002Flong bars.  The entry door closes on a tight spring so if you are alone this may be difficult. There is one king bed. The 'kitchen' is very, very tiny and placed just beside the side of the bed. It is not separate. Has a frig, cupboards, microwave, coffee maker, and possibly other things?? -check with hotel. Handicap parking above ground is good. There is underground too.\n\n2. Parking is $10 a day (above and below ground available)\n3. Bedding is in the upper end (what might normally be in a home) and clean.\n4. Pets are $75 per stay.\n5. This hotel offers a fantastic breakfast served buffet style. During my stay it included: scrambled eggs, bacon or sausage, pancakes, french toast, potatoes, do-it-yourself waffles, muffins, danishes, home-made loafs, bread, fresh fruit (different days -different fruit: apples, bananas, oranges, raspberries, blueberries, watermelon), plain yogurt with sides of fresh cut up fruit (not canned) including melons, pinapple, oranges, grapes, etc., frozen strawberries in own juice, cereals, hot oatmeal porridge in a slow cooker, lots of fixings eg: brown sugar, granola, PLUS delicious coffee (mmmmm) and tea, milks, cream, whipped cream.  During my visit food was cooked EXTREMELY well -not greasy, and was very consistent day-to-day.\n6. This hotel also offered supper Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday only (called their social hour) which was nice too if you didn't want to make supper in your kitchen. I think I saw salads and something hot too, plus deserts, and coffee etc. again.  Quite nice if you like this.\n7. If you are still reading this....I recommend you call and confirm exactly what 'type' of kitchen is in your room if the kitchen is important to you.  From what I could determine what is in your kitchen is dependent on your room size.  Our kitchen was an excellent size, inlcuded a diswasher & soap, dishes, a stove top, and there was a 'dining room' table with four chairs.\n8. Our room had lots of storage and mirrors which was really nice.\n9. Decor was nice to very nice.\n10. There were two LCD flat screen TVs and a BOSS radio in the bedroom.\n11.

We had a two bedroom unit which was a very good size plus it had a separate living room and kitchen.  While we didn't eat meals there, you could have certainly used the kitchen for morning breakfasts and lunch if you wanted.  Location was convenient  to a number of restaurants in downtown London and being central, you could get to all the rinks in less than 15 minutes no matter where they were in town including one in the far east end.  Sleep was comfortable although not very sound proof as you could hear the other rooms when they were up early.  Staff were very pleasant and helpful\n\nBreakfast buffet was average and struggled a little with how busy the hotel was on the Sunday morning but the staff tried very hard.  The only other concern was that it only has two elevators.  With over 120 units in the hotel, it can be a little slow at times.  Also, it doesn't have a pool on site which meant less for the kids to do but offsetting this, the hotel staff let us use the restaurant area and patio for a team bbq which worked out really well.\n\nOverall.  Good value for money.",4,positive

My business partner who lives in the US has been a big fan of the chain and I now know why.\nI spent 3 nights there in October....both of my children go to Western, so it was a good chance to go and spend a little time without encroaching on their space.  The suite was fantastic....I had the 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom with  a kitchen that included an oven.  All of the suites have a stovetop but only some have the oven....ask before you book!  I thought I would have some relaxing time with my London friends but because I had this great \""apartment\"" I found myself stuck in the kitchen for most of the time preparing food for my kids!!! \nThis hotel does book hockey teams and parties but I think they have a low tolerance for noise.  I was in my room on a Friday night and heard a loud party going on....not on my floor ( I was on the top floor) but the one below or even below that.  Before I could even call the front desk, 11:00 rolled around and then there was silence! \nThe staff at his place is amazing!  The front desk people who I had the pleasure of dealing with were Ashley, Scott, Tina and trainee Mathew ( keep him!)...in no particular order.\nNote to management....when answering the phone at the hotel....can you please shorten the intro that the staff has to say?  How about...\""Residence Inn, so and so speaking, can I help you\""?...instead of that huge mouthful that they have to say and that we customers have to listen to?  So painful!!\nBack to the rest of the staff....I think they are either all really super helpful and friendly or have been trained very well....probably a combination of both...everywhere I went, they were all so nice and wishing us a nice day, but they actually seemed very genuine.\nA big thanks to Melissa in housekeeping who took time from her busy schedule...on a Saturday morning no less!!! to show me some different room types. I tried for the 3 days I was there to get a tour but it wasn't possible at that particular moment, or the site manager was in a meeting or whatever.\nAfter expressing my frustration to Melissa in the hallway on check-out day, she very kindly showed me the different suite types and even wrote them all out for me.  Thanks to her I found that there are really no bad rooms at this hotel, if I could not get the one I wanted, the alternative is just as good.\nI am going back this week and have some nights booked again in December, I am so happy to have 'discovered\"" this great little gem in London!",5,positive

The place was clean and quaint. Some of the parts of the room are a little run down but I am super picky and am used to staying in fairly luxurious hotels, so that being said, I was pretty happy with the suite even with it not being absolutely stunning. It was clean and cared for and really big and functional.\nWhen we checked out, my husband had packed up our stuff while I was at the hotel gym. He hadn't realized I had put most of my stuff in the dresser and MISSED TAKING IT HOME WITH US! I didn't even realize until a few days later, once at home, and I was trying to find one of my shirts and couldn't locate it anywhere. We immediately called the hotel as I had a lot of things that must have been left there - a gorgeous sweater, a bunch of shirts, bras, undies, pants, skirts, etc., all totalling over $2000 at least (I brought some nice and even new things!). Housekeeping informed me that they had it ALL and arranged to send it back to me in Oakville. They even used as small a box as possible to keep my shipping cost down. I was so impressed that my stuff didn't go missing after a few days of me not even noticing and leaving it there! Top quality staff who chose to do the right thing (which seems to happen less and less in our world today!). Very relieved and very grateful! Thank you, Marriott!",5,positive
data/ca/154995/186943/484905105.html,Residence Inn London Downtown,"""My husband, 15 yo son and I traveled to London to visit friends for a weekend. We booked a King room with a pullout sofa. The day before our trip the Marriott app asked us if we wanted to check-in. I thought this was odd, but it occurred to me that some people may be arriving early morning. \n\nThe hotel isn't much to look at from the outside but it was easy to find. We checked in using the app before arriving so it was a simple matter of picking up the keycard at the desk. The staff was pleasant. The hotel layout is unique. The room floor is laid out in an infinity symbol pattern with 5 rooms in each loop. We were in the middle room. \n\nThe room itself is also an interesting layout. The door opens to a hallway with closets on each side. The end of the hall opens to a rectangular shaped room. One side has the kitchenette, the \""living room\"" and a table against a support beam with 2 chairs. The table is rectangular and doubles as the desk. There is plenty of space for two people to work with laptops. The room is partially divided by a dresser which sticks out from the windows with a TV on a swivel mount. The dresser drawers face the bed. A very small bathroom is located next to the bed. \n\nEven though we had a king size bed, it seemed small. I have run into this before and was told that a \""hotel king\"" is not the same size as a king bed purchased for home use. Despite the size, it was comfortable. My bigger issue was with the bathroom. It's very small. It does have a tub\u002Fshower combo and dual sinks, but it takes some maneuvering to be in the bathroom and get the door closed. It does have really nice water pressure and the hot water gets really hot. The wall in front of the sinks is sloped so the room is narrower the further into the bathroom you go. Another small annoyance is the placement of the dresser. It's a small 6 drawer dresser, which is fine, put it's placed against the windows so the curtains are always catching in the dresser drawers. It's not a major issue but if I was staying for more than a few days I would have been tempted to move the furniture to avoid the annoyance. \n\nThe kitchenette was well equipped but we didn't use it other than to store drinks in the refrigerator. One day we went down for the continental breakfast. it's the standard fair for a Marriott. The actual food layout was good but there was very little seating available and we ended up taking our plates to our room. \n\nThe biggest issue with the hotel is parking. There is a very small, maybe 10 spaces, lot which you need a ticket for. The staff asked about a vehicle when we arrived and promptly gave us the ticket so we could park there. When the lot is full there is an underground parking garage that you can access with your keycard. There is a sharp turn as soon as you enter the garage, which is marked by a concrete pole. We had only a few inches of clearance trying to turn into it. The concrete poles are placed every two spaces, which caused a lot of people to park badly to be away from the pole, making the second space unusable. Some spaces are impossible for an SUV or van because the turn into the space is too sharp. \n\nOne thing I loved is how quiet it was. We were 2 blocks from a train rail and we never heard the train go by. Twice we heard sirens from a police car or ambulance but other than that it was really quiet. \n\nOverall we enjoyed the stay. If we return we will likely try a different hotel within the same brand, mainly because of the parking issues.",4,positive

It just increases the value that you get from this hotel. My rate per night was $124\u002Fnight, EXTREMELY reasonable.  \n\nThe room is extremely spacious with more room than one person could ever need. One of the main reasons I stayed here was the full kitchenette provided.

The decor in the room is decent - it's not over the top but still extremely nice. I found this room to be extremely quiet, with excellent functioning air conditioning. The beds are fantastic. I had an excellent sleep all of the nights I was here. The pillow selection was amazing. \n\nThe location of this hotel is perfect - located downtown enough to easily access all attractions that London has to offer (great bars\u002Frestaurants, etc.).

The parking garage is very tight on space, but we managed to get our larger suv parked.

Once I was checked in, I just enjoyed lounging in the room. I ordered room service that evening and it was delicious! Pasta, shrimp cocktail and two desserts. Absolutely divine. \nBreakfast came with the package and it was more than I was expecting. Bacon, eggs, homefries, fruit, cheese, breads and pastries. Best scrambled eggs I have ever had! \nThey were lovely and gave me the option of a late check out but I didn't need to use it.\nAll in all this was a great place to stay with lovely staff, a fantastic spa, luxurious rooms and a delicious restaurant.

This formed the warm and welcoming beginning to our stay at the Idlewyld Inn and Spa.  The hotel is lovely and is located in a nice residential neighborhood in London.  The rooms are very nice and the beds comfortable - with a large bathroom and a glass enclosed rain-head shower,  The dinning room is also beautiful and the wait-staff attentive, knowledgeable, and very, very willing to accommodate their guests. In our case one of our children had called ahead (form downstate New York) and wanted to treat us to a dinner for 4 as a gift ... no problem.  And when an additional guest came at the last minute and sat at our table his request that he be billed separately  was again treated with grace and understanding.  When we selected a bottle red wine to have with a dinner (which was excellently prepared and delicious), it was properly decanted and served only when it reached its full bloom.

Downstairs looks and feels like a lovely old inn, upstairs; not so much.\n\nNo table in between the two chairs to set one's coffee (whitened with the provided Coffee Mate).\nTake your reading glasses into the walk in shower because the print on the shampoo, conditioner & shower gel bottles is so small you won't be able to tell which is which, and they weren't all that great of quality anyway.\nFridge sounded like a Boeing 747 so I had to unplug it. \nDrab, ho hum decor, picture of a peacock was chosen I assume because it matched the blue chairs ? No art is better than bad art.\nCarpeted floors, so take your slippers. \nThe bedside lights turn off and on via a switch mounted on the wall wired with the vestibule light so you can't just have bed lights on and you have to get out of bed to turn the lights off. \nI didn't try on a robe as they looked to be very small.\n\nThankfully the short curtains blocked the many spot lights from outside, too bad they didn't quieten the noise from the front patio or the late night smokers. Glad the windows opened and closed to get some fresh air in when I was out during the day.\n\nBed was comfortable as were the pillows, although they were all the same firmness. Towels were okay, but not big and luxurious as one would expect at an \""inn & spa\"". \n\nThe best thing was getting lunch (separate review for the dining room on Trip Advisor; lunch was great, dinner was not, service was good, breakfast okay but hard to reach some of the platters on top of the bar.) \n\nI also had a pedicure.

We arrived at 5pm on a week night so was not very busy at first and then really picked up with diners later in the evening.\nOur waiter was most professional and tended to our needs without being overbearing.  I saw all wait staff conducting themselves in the same manner with the guests.  I don't want to criticize many young waitstaff out there who are most professional and dedicated but many staff here on this particular night were older, well versed in dining service and never missed a beat to meet the diners needs.\nThe food was absolute perfection in every manner of presentation and taste.\nThursdays in the summer is a BBQ night where a set price will allow for a choice of gourmet salads set up in the dining room, your choice of meats being grilled outside and dessert.  My husband ordered the Jerk Chicken and he relayed that right down to the roasted potatoes served with this dishl was the best tasting meal he has had in London in a very long time.  Grilled perfectly with great yet not overwhelming taste.\nI had a mushroom pasta with oyster mushrooms that I found to be decadent and rich.

Didn't book spa appts this time around b\u002Fc of health & cleanliness issues we experienced on our last stay. #2 website states tv's & DVD players are avble in all the rooms. Decided to stay in this time around for one of the 2 nights, & enjoy wine & movies. Little did we know the players that were \""avble in the rooms\"" were none functioning. The manager had emailed me to see how our stay was going thus far & at this point I mentioned 2 issues. That the DVD player did not work & the extractor fan in our bathroom was also not working. I had not rec'd a response during our stay from the manager. I had attempted to phone the front desk regarding the fan being repaired however I did not think getting the player repaired during our stay was realistic. Upon checking out the manager wished to meet us & follow up on our stay. I mentioned that everything was great aside from the 2 issues I mentioned in my email. To which she respd 'which issues'? leaving me to believe she hadn't even read the email. At that point I reiterated; The resp from the manager was nothing but excuses. She stated that if I had placed a tissue directly under the fan it would have suctioned displaying it works. When I stated to the manager that during my hot showers with the fan on the fogginess in the room did not subside unless the window was opened, she insisted saying the fan worked. She also stated that players were avble at the front desk. Why it wasn't mentioned in a response email? Little issues however I believe it is the littlest things that count. Michael, the front desk manager was very accommodating & friendly and the welcome back gift was certainly a surprise. Wish I could say the same for the Inn manager. The room however was very clean; but I agree with some of the other reviews, bed and pillows weren't comfortable. But what bed, that isn't yours is?

The property was built in 1878 and has been lovingly restored and rooms have been completely modernized.  Front desk and restaurant staff were all first rate.  Had booked 3 rooms with king\u002Fqueen beds.  They did vary quite substantially in size, but all were spotless and very nicely appointed.  First of all, the absolute best lighting we\u2019ve ever encountered in both the room and bathroom \u2013 so much appreciated.  Lots of choices for mood lighting up to very well lit for working\u002Freading.  Good closet space, nice amount of hangers, but no hangers with clips which I like for pants\u002Fskirts as we always bring a small steamer for wrinkles, (bring my own hangars anyway, but most people don\u2019t).   Fluffy terry bathrobes and excellent slippers were provided. \n\nVery nice furnishings, a  good sized desk, a couple of chairs,  including a good sized mini fridge, coffee\u002Ftea maker.   Excellent bed \u2013 very comfy mattress and pillows (6 in total in the room) and lovely quality bedding.  The bathroom wasn\u2019t large but well laid out with ample hooks and racks.  Good sized make-up mirror.   Very impressed with the mirror on the outside of the bathroom door \u2013 which meant that when you opened it, it was opposite to the vanity mirror providing a perfect view of the back of your head \u2013 very helpful when trying to check out your blow dry or if putting your hair up.  Also another full length mirror in the room. Very nice toiletries, although the bath gel container in the shower could be a bit larger \u2013 doesn\u2019t lather that well, so it\u2019s barely enough for 2 people.     Climate control was fine, but a bit confusing at first \u2013 they have ductless climate control but we didn\u2019t realize that the controls only worked if you picked up the console out of the holder and pointed it at the machine.  We have a ductless at home with a remote, but I\u2019ve only seen wall mounted controls in hotel rooms before so it never occurred to us that the hotel thermostat was a remote.\n\nSleep quality was excellent  -  black-out curtains; windows have screens if you want to open them; rooms were very quiet.\n\nThe restaurant is a real treat.  Interesting well executed menu, my one critique was some items were on the salty side.  Very comfortable upholstered chairs and lovely ambiance \u2013 also tables out front of the hotel and a very popular patio out back.  Between various functions which are held here and the general popularity of the hotel restaurant, be sure to reserve for lunch or dinner.  The continental breakfast which was included in our room rate was great.  Assorted fresh cut fruit, yogurt, cottage cheese, granola, smoked salmon, cheeses, breads\u002Fbagels to toast and housemade pastries and preserves.  Our son had been out quite late for graduation celebrations but we had to leave fairly early and they were more than happy to provide takeout containers for him to bring anything he wanted from the buffet including take-out cups for juice and coffee so he could curl up in the back of the car and munch away.  My son was also impressed that the hotel provides very pretty and large  stoppered, carafes of their own filtered bottled water if you wish. \n\nThey have a spa which we didn\u2019t get a chance to try.   No more university students anymore, but my husband and I would love to go back for a getaway.

My mother had wanted to visit her home town after having been away for decades and the Idlewyld Inn & Spa provided the ideal home for us to use in our visit.  \n\nWe are not easy hotel clients: my mother (who is into her 90's and relies on a wheelchair) does not move quickly--but her standards are extremely high. Let me give a few examples; that might help explain our extremely positive and enthusiastic review of the Idlewyld Inn.  \n\nThe excellence of the staff started with help from the front desk in selecting our room.  They recommended the Library to us, which was perfect for our wheelchair needs.  True, a grab bar or two in the bathroom would be a nice addition, but we had space to manouvre, and transfers to the bed were easy.  It was beautifully peaceful and quiet, despite our proximity to the reception desk and Spa--and the housekeeping staff seemed to anticipate our every need.  The rooms were spotless after their visits.  it was amazing!\n\nThe front desk (Effie included) found a wheelchair accessible hair dresser for us and accepted deliveries of historical documents delivered to us.  Needless to say, the front desk staff greeted us with smiles and personal greetings as we came and went.\n\nThe restaurant was exceptional.  We cannot speak highly enough of the imaginative lunches and dinners.  We found the main meals so delicious that a light continental breakfast with fresh fruit, lox and bagels, homemade granola, and a selection of bread and yogurt was perfect for us.  The chef and his team in the kitchen went out of their way to prepare delicious dinners for us, though we often appeared at the end of the evening's service.  Brian, Reba, and the other front staff were attentive to every need and provided excellent recommendations on both the wine and the single malt scotch.\n\nThe chairs in the dining room were extremely comfortable and the perfect height for a leisurely dining experience. Again, we appreciated such things as the arm rests, making it easy to transfer from wheelchair to dining room chair and ideal for relaxing over a digestif after dinner. The patio in the summer is the place to eat, however, because of the stunning garden (and amazing gardener who provided information, guidance on plant care, and a freshly cut bouquet of floors for our room).\n\nWe used the Spa and the staff were wonderful in finding ways to get an ancient body into the pedicure bath\u002Fchair.  Shawna provided some very useful tips for keeping older feet healthy--what a bonus!\n\nWe have mentioned our mobility limitation not because this is, by any means, an ideal hotel for disabled--but because our experience demonstrated how far the staff would go in making our stay as perfect as possible.  We also had the most profound appreciation for the respectful way that the owners have restored the house to its original elegance, while still providing upgrades to building code to allow for good water flow, electical outlets everywhere, and marvelous air flow.\n\nWhat would I change?  I might install a hook to keep the front door open while bringing in luggage, and perhaps a grab bar in the shower.  We couldn't have asked for anything more and we left the Idlewyld Inn and Spa as relaxed, well-rested, and well-fed as we've been  in years.",5,positive

She was a wonderful listener and was on-point with our few special meal requests and wine choices. We loved the fact that they do NOT nickel and dime you at every opportunity. The reception we had in the wine cellar with my fear of being eaten alive by mosquitoes. We designed but their set-up was perfect. A very special shout out to Edward, Norman, Katherine, and we had a very sweet blonde girl, (I am so sorry I forget your name but you were absolutely lovely) Food was phenomenal. Nobody stood around long waiting for a drink. The service was over-the-top fantastic.\n\nThe room was wonderful. This is the most romantic hotel I\u2019ve ever seen.

It was recently purchased by a successful London Businessman and fully refurbished.  It is a 21 room Inn and Spa with a delightful restaurant and various meeting rooms and a large casual outdoor patio.  It had several unique private dining areas all of which were perfectly maintained and located either indoors or outdoors and in a manner which allowed the age and character of the former mansion to the Mayor to be appreciated. Great options for group events\u002Fdining in my opinion.  We had an opportunity to meet the lovely manager and receive a brief tour of @ 5 guest rooms and hear about the History of the rpoerty and renovation.  The manager was as charming and lovely as the Inn.   Each room had a unique layout and presented a combination of modern luxury within a traditional space.  We were equally impressed with the simplest room to the honeymoon suite.  All appeared nicely appointed with fresh white linens and modern bedding and headbords and the bathrooms were also modern and updated.  This was offset in some cases by wonderful dark wood moulding, incredible original shutters and beautiful fireplaces. Two rooms that we saw offered small decks.  They were absolutely beautiful and although it is right off of Richmond St. and no more than a ten minute drive from Western or the main London strip  you felt like you were away from the hustle and bustle of a city.   The flowers surrounding the grounds were spectacular.  This will be the only place we stay for future London visits. It offers luxury and charm--hopefully next time I can enjoy the spa. I wouldn't suggest this for young families looking for amenities such as a pool to keep their kids entertained, i would suggets this is absolutely perfect for couples or single adults looking for a little more than the standard London hotels.  NB. We only had time to enjoy lunch on the patio and the food was fresh and well prepared and presented.

Ok but since you can't book online and you have to call, perhaps the staff taking the booking could mention this as some rooms have them. There were two arm chairs in the room but no table so coffee cups, books etc went on the floor.

Included in the package was a couples massage, breakfast and a credit towards dinner.  Our dining experience was excellent, both the food and the service.  Our waitress was very personable and we thoroughly enjoyed her commentary of the food.  Overall the appearance of our room was very clean and surprisingly updated and stylish.  However, we later discovered that the mattress was extremely hard as we woke up with sore backs. When it was time to check-in for our massage, I requested a receipt so that both my husband I could claim the cost with our work insurance benefit.  Unfortunately, I was told that the therapists for the couple massages were not registered.  I was shocked and asked why wasn\u2019t this explained at the time of booking or posted on any of their marketing materials (like their website)?  Her response is that most people don\u2019t have insurance so they don\u2019t say anything unless the guests asks.  I was extremely disappointed in this response as I would argue that over the recent years, there is an increasing number of working people who have massage therapy covered under their group benefits at work.  Also she said if I wanted registered massages, then I should have booked a different package and booked and paid for the massages separately.  Wait my experience gets even better.  After our massages were finished, we find out that one of the therapists is registered so we asked for a receipt for one of us.  The same lady told us no because it was part of a package.  Ugh!

It made me feel like dressing up although that was not a requirement. The facility is beautiful, desk team was friendly and accommodating, restaurant on par with premium, the spa is small but has exceptional staff   Ladies get the detailed manicure.  The premium room was worth the upgrade, spacious with a lovely view of the front garden, and great mattress.  The rooms were a little more 20-teens genre than 1800's but I liked that.

All staff that I encountered were polite, friendly and took their time to be helpful and pleasant.\nMy room was nice and cozy, with all the amenities I enjoy.  The only down side to mention is that 'noise travels' in an older home, so it was not surprising to hear other guests talking or walking around.\nThe food and service in the dining room was excellent.  The servers are professional and are quite willing to accurately describe every dish on the menu, which is helpful when trying to decide on an entree.

Our room on the third floor was large, comfortable, clean and everything one could ask for after a day\u2019s travelling and sightseeing.  The only, small, flies in the ointment were that there was no plug in the bathroom sink and, by some quirk of electrical wiring, it was not possible to have the bedside light on without the ceiling light over the door also on.  The Inn was very busy with a wedding and they could not seat us for dinner till 20.45, rather late for us.  On the Inn\u2019s recommendation we took a 10 minute walk to Wortley Village where there was a selection of good cafes and restaurants.  The moral here: book ahead of time to make sure you can eat in.  One would imagine that the Inn might e-mail clients coming on a busy Saturday with a suggestion to book.\n\nStaff were pleasant and helpful throughout.\n\nIt was quite warm when we stayed and we had breakfast outside in the terrace in gorgeous surroundings.  The breakfast was maybe a bit disappointing in terms of the choice of cooked food.\n\nSo, how to rate?  Certainly a four and a half.  Does it deserve the accolade of a five?

The manicured gardens and grounds, and the exterior of the inn show a well-maintained property.  Once inside, the detailed woodwork of the mantlepieces and antique furniture keep with the historical flavour of the past.   \n\nService:  The service was excellent.  As soon as we arrived, reception was friendly and helpful.  Check-in and check-out were swift.  The waiters in the dining area were attentive without being overbearing.  \n\nFood:  Both the dinner and continental breakfast the following morning at the Inn's restaurant on the main level were delicious.  \n\nRoom:  Well-appointed and comfortable room size.  The bathroom was almost new with fresh paint, fixtures, shower.  \n\nSpa:  My wife and I enjoyed a couples Swedish massage, and it was relaxing and soothing.  It was just what we needed. \n\nNeeds:  I stayed in Room 301, and the king mattress seemed a little on the soft side, but that is a personal preference.  Housekeeping staff:  please dust all areas of the room, because the step below the window bench was dusty as well as the areas around the bed.  Maintentance staff:  the window was very dirty and had not been cleaned in some time.  Management:  A minor issue, due to the sloped ceilings, was the mirrors in the room, I'm only 5'9\"", but I had to bend over to use the oval mirror in the washroom to shave, and also the room wall mirror was low.  Perhaps the sloping ceiling is part of the charm of the building, but a full-length standing mirror in the room would be an improvement.     \n  \nOverall Rating:  Service was excellent, Food was excellent, Ambiance was excellent, Spa was excellent, Room was ok.  The needs can be easily solved, and I'm picky, but for the five-star price, I believe certain standards of cleanliness should be met. Would I come again?

Room was clean and comfortable, but a little \""old\"" smelling (maybe not seeing enough airing out).  Very nicely decorated.

Generally, the others we encountered kept pretty much to themselves and not much cross conversation or how-do-you-do's (we are from US, so B&B's are often chatty places; it didn't seem as such here, but might have been since we had children and the other clients we encountered were more elderly couples).  Spa seemed very popular (though I didn't use).  Nearby neighborhood was described as historic--which is true, but we expected more beautiful buildings of the same type nearby.  None of what we saw very close were as pretty as the Inn.  We did find some lovely older homes when we went to see Gibbons park.  Very gorgeous homes near that area and a nice park.\n\nReceptionists were very nice both in evening and morning.  Breakfast that was included was sufficient and included smoked salmon, yogurt with granola, fresh pineapple and melon, scrambled eggs, bacon, toast, bagels, breakfast potatoes, cottage cheese, cheese cubes... a few danish I think.

To a person, everyone was friendly, warm, welcoming and helpful. Our guests all remarked how lovely the staff was, no matter the time of day.  We kept Norman up helping us with Scotch one evening until nearly 10 and he was back at breakfast the next day with a smile on.  The same was true after our wedding reception.  The staff who closed up at midnight were back and friendly the next morning. Not a grump among them!\nThe Inn is from the mid-1800 and was built as a private residence.  The building has retained a lot of it's unique charm but has been updated for guest comfort with firm beds, sleek minimalist modern furniture that compliments the old style and nice new bathrooms. It's more than comfortable without being over the top.  During our visit in June, all the rooms had either a portable air conditioner, fan or both.\nEffie, the manager and wedding coordinator, really cares about the guests and that transcends through the rest of the staff and the way they do business.

This apparently is only one of two rooms (the other being the White House) still around from that era.  We had lunch at the inn before heading in for our spa treatments. The balsamic vinegar and olive oil, from The Pristine Olive Tasting Bar, they served with their bread was incredible. The entire team at the Idlewyld inn was friendly, accommodating and welcoming.

We were told to call a couple hours before arrival and it shouldn't be a problem.  The person we spoke to was very cordial.  We called again while in transit and were told it was not possible and nothing could be done, that we should have been aware of the 3pm check-in time.

We arrived in London at about 11:30am so we stopped at the hotel to see if check-in may be possible anyway as we had more than an hour before the wedding \u2013 again we were told that there was nothing they could do.  The front desk manager, K. Perez, was very curt and cold, almost robotic.  I realize we were asking for a very early check-in but given the circumstances thought they may at least try to help.  As an aside. I\u2019m also an IHG rewards member with numerous nights at Holiday Inn hotels logged in the past year (which is clear from my points balance and was part of my reservation\u2026no consideration for frequent patrons I guess).  Also, the hotel wasn't remotely full, given the lack of cars in both hotel parking lots \u2013 not two dozen cars between both lots.\n\nWe returned after the ceremony around 3pm to check-in.  Same person, K. Perez, but it was as if we'd never spoke - very strange.  Repeated much of the same information and was then informed that booking policies changed in February and my rate was not valid, that I should have seen that on the website when I booked.  I explained I had just stayed at a Holiday Inn in Halifax, NS, using the same rate discount in November and had no issues, and I didn\u2019t see anything to negate my booking when selecting the applicable rate.  I was curtly told that, as she already said, it changed in February and I would have to pay the full rate - $200 all-in for one night, just over $50 more than the booked rate.  I was so discouraged and didn't argue as we needed to change quickly and head to the reception...so we accepted and paid.\n\nWe got to the room - king bed - to discover it to be the size of a NYC hotel room...extremely small.  Very disappointing all around.  To be honest, the small room likely wouldn\u2019t have been an issue for us otherwise, but after everything we then walk into a room less than 200 square feet.\n\nWhat was good?  The location \u2013 but as I mentioned, there are several other hotels in the area.

As a Holiday Inn rewards member we have always enjoyed staying in their hotels... until this one. The day began alright until dinner came around and on our way down to the lobby in the elevator it broke. All 15 passengers remained calm and we called the front desk to alert them of the issue... they were less than helpful. We were told to be patient while they tried to contact the elevator people to come, 20 minutes later nothing still had changed other than the fact that one of the guests that were stuck in the elevator had gone into medical distress and fell to the floor. It was up to us to deal with the problem since the hotel staff were less and willing to communicate. We called 911 and told them what had happened and that we needed help and to our surprise we were the first ones to make them aware of the situation. The staff was extremely unhelpful and not the least bit professional, no updates were given and the staff could be heard laughing over the intercom rather than worrying about their guests that were trapped in the elevator. After about an hour we were finally let out of the elevator and went straight to the front desk where the girl was very rude and inconsiderate, we tried to explain what had just happened to her and she just smirked, shrugged her shoulders and said \""ok\"" repeatedly. We asked to be given access to the stairs (which were locked so that guests couldn't use them) so that we could get up to our room and then were told \""they aren't for guest access\"" and that we could use the other elevator to go upstairs, as you can imagine that was the last thing we wanted to do after being trapped for an hour. I then left my cell number to have the manager call me.. this never happened and I made several attempts to reach him. I finally tracked down the manger almost 20 minutes who seemed to be in a rush and inconvenienced when I asked him to let me upstairs he did not have the time to discuss the issue and said he would call me later that evening.. he never did. Life went on and we went for dinner but when we returned back from dinner BOTH parking lots were full, I then called the hotel very annoyed with everything we had been through and was instructed to park in the impark lot just down the street, once I got there it was full as well. I then went into the hotel to speak to the manager who was \""not available at the time\"" and was then told to park at the funeral home across the street, this is after I already paid the $14 to park at the hotel. We went back to the room and went to sleep completely regretting our choice in hotels for the weekend, by morning since I still could not get ahold of the manger I called the customer support centre and they were very helpful although they also could not reach the manager because he didn't start until 12 that day... very annoying as check out is 11. We were given a late check out for 1pm and told the manger would call us that day before we checked out to get everything figured out. I called him at 12:45 and he was less than helpful he just kept offering excuses then he took our parking fee off the bill and the $45 they were going to charge us for a late check out that they never told us about as well as two sleep masks.

I didn't have the breakfast as I brought my own stuff, but I've heard good things about it. The bar fridge was clean and had enough room for my drinks and some sandwiches, etc. I was able to hook up my Playbook to the HDTV quite easily but if you are not technically inclined, I would not advise it. The wi-fi worked ok but I didn't use it much. The shower was great! Terrific pressure, the right temperature, and lots of towels. I even liked the complimentary body lotion, soap, shampoo and conditioner they provided.

It is pretty centrally located in terms of downtown London.  The block it is on is a tiny bit sketchy (e.g. pawn shop at one corner), but not at all bad for London standards.  It's an 8 minute walk from Dundas and Richmond, so the convenient location is nice.  That being said, the fact that it's right on Dundas does make it a tiny bit noisier than I would like, but there isn't a lot of traffic around this portion of Dundas so it's really only an issue when larger vehicles pass by.  \n\nCheck-in and check-out process was very efficient, and everyone was nice. If you sign up for their rewards program they'll let you check out at 2:00 pm which was great.\n\nThe room itself was a pleasant surprise for this price-range.  It has a massive TV, has clearly had a reno recently and all rooms include some pretty fast wifi and a very comfortable work station.  The rooms also have fancy thermostats that allow for plenty of control, though the AC system is pretty loud.  On the bright side, it does provide for some white noise to help with the sounds from the road.\n\nThe only slight downside to the place is that the hallways are a little grubby, the elevators are extremely slow and the sliding doors at the entrance of the hotel are extremely old and loud.

Room key was a card that we also needed to swipe in the elevator to get to our floor.\n\nThe room was a decent size with clean, simple decor, and we had a view of the street infront of the hotel.  Amenities included free high-speed internet, a fridge, a microwave, alarm clock with CD player and two telephones (one next to the bed and another one at the work station).  The bed was comfortable and they provided both hard and soft pillows.  The bathroom was spacious and spotless, and the shower was quite good as well.

And, after checking us all in the staff person somewhat sternly informed me that as I was in charge of the group I should know that they had a strict noise policy. We would be warned once, and then we would be assessed a $100 fee for every subsequent noise infraction because \""they compensate guests who complain about the noise.\"" We assured them that we would be fine. \n\nAt checkout we notified the front desk that within our group we had called the front desk a total of some 11 times because players were loud - and because some parents were drunkenly loud as well.

I was wrong. Maybe because I had to book myself for the weekend (all the business people left), I did not enjoy my stay. I must have got a sports team, and some people that were concert goers.\n\nThe hotel was noisy. I do not blame the Holiday Inn for how noisy the guests are, because it was the weekend. But I do blame the Holiday Inn's layout. The doors for the hotel rooms are not staggered. This means that your room is facing your neighbour's room. How awkward would it be if you came up at the same time? Anyway, there is a huge gap between the door and the floor, so obviously, you can hear the sound. I could hear the housekeepers knocking on the door across from me, saying \""housekeeping\"" in the day time, and I could hear my neighbour's conversation word for word, even if they were speaking quietly. Fix the doors so that they are closer to the ground, and make the doors close slowly and quietly. I was awoken every time someone in the hallway opened a door. These are fixable things (although it may be costly), because I understand that neighbours can be loud.\n\nAnother weird thing was that my ironing board was super wrinkled. If I had more delicate fabrics I would have been a little more annoyed. My iron leaked water. However, the staff were extremely helpful to me, and it made me feel better about my stay. \n\nIt's also weird too, that you have to swipe your card key to get your complimentary breakfast. Some websites say the breakfast is continental, but you do get eggs and bacon, so I wouldn't consider it continental. For that, this hotel can be one of the better deals for central London. I know someone complained that the breakfast room was small, but on the weekend there was a seat for everyone.\n\nPros:\nFree breakfast\nNice staff\nBouncy carpet\nI would consider this a pretty good hotel for a weekday in Central London\nThe pillows, bed and bedding were comfy\n\nCons:\nSwiping your card for breakfast when your brain isn't working (a lot of people stood at the door for a while before they realized)\nThe soundproofing is awful.

I stayed at the Delta the last time and I was very pleased (check my previous review).  The one and only reason that I opted to try the Holiday Inn on this trip was due to my desire to add to my IHG points, which was a big mistake.  I would gladly forego my points to stay at the Delta (they have a loyalty program as well).   \n\n- The Holiday Inn Express in Downtown London, ON is an old Hotel and needs a complete update.  The outside night photo makes it look nice but it really isn't.  Others have referred to it as dumpy, which sadly, it's not too far off from that description.    \n\n- The King bed was not comfortable and you could visibly see the dip in the mattress.  It needs to be replaced. \n\n- The hall carpets on the 7th floor (and possibly other floors) were stained in at least two areas about the the size of a small kids bicycle tire from what looked like urine.  \n\n- What others have said about this location trying to squeeze more cash out of you may be true as I had inquired about a 1 hour extended checkout and I was advised that it would be an extra $25.  I have stayed at other Holiday Inn locations as well as other chains and I have never been asked to provide any additional funds for simply 1 hour.  2-3 hours I can understand, but 1 hour?  #GreedyMuch?\n\n- The parking lot is difficult to park in if you have anything larger than a compact car.  It's dingy and I wouldn't let any females that I know walk alone in there by themselves day or night.\n\n- Homeless people were seen hanging out near the parking garage probably trying to stay warm.  And apparently, they hang out in the morning trying to sneak in to grab breakfast.  \n    \n- The breakfast may be included in the stay, but it was bland which is consistent with the chain's other locations that I have stayed at.

I have stayed at a lot of other Holiday Inn Express establishments, and this has to be the worst one. You aren\u2019t able to walk on the street in front of the hotel without being yelled at by crack dealers, and drunks. Driving by the area, we see that there is a homeless shelter almost a block away, and a mental heath centre 2 blocks away. This hotel has many safety violations, and will be in contact with the TSSA very soon.\n\nOn the website, it Is said that they have a pool, but that is a lie. They give you a coupon to the YMCA to use their facilities, as the hotel doesn\u2019t have a pool. There is a gym with exercise equipment, but the room is about half the size as a standard room, so it is hot and stuffy in there. The room has a television with about 30 channels, none of them children channels, so the kids were not very happy about that, since we paid about $120 for the room each night for 2 nights. \n\nThe vicinity of the hotel is utterly disgusting. You go about 20m from the hotel in either direction and in one, you will see drunks on a patio, or a couple in the discount hotel beside us having \u201Cfun\u201D. Go in another direction, you will see a bunch of drug addicts looking for dealers. In the back (our view) it is a parking lot, and with no security whatsoever. There are 2 cameras that say its monitored 24\u002F7, but asking the front desk, they say that they are not functioning. We were very shocked when we heard that the door in the parking garage doesn\u2019t close, so anyone can break into your car, steal your belongings ect. \n\nThe worst of the worst, was the elevators and the stairs. Out of the 2 elevators, only 1 was functioning. This was most frustrating as we were in a rush to get out, and there are may people waiting for the elevator, and is taking forever for them to come. In the hotel, you would expect the stairs to go from the basement to the highest floor. But in the Holiday Inn Express in London, Ontario, the stairs start from the SECOND Floor, and there are 2 options to get to the main floor: go outside in pitch black, or wait 20 minutes for an elevator. This is a safety violation, so if there was a fire in the basement, how would you get up? \n\nJust to sum this up, don\u2019t stay here, you will honestly regret it. Desiree at the front desk made it an even worse stay. If you do stay here, (not a good choice) sign up for their priority card and you will get parking for free. Save $11 a day.

What really makes this hotel is the people who work there.  Everyone I came into contact with was friendly and more than willing to go above and beyond to help when any issues arose.\n\nThe rooms are a bit small and dated.  The walls are thin!  They are very clean however and the bed was comfortable.\n\nWith that being said, the night I stayed there was a lot of noise at 3am which meant little to no sleep for me.  People yelling in the hallways, going in and out of the stairwells.  Security came by - how did I know this?  I could hear his radio which was at a volume loud enough to be heard across the whole floor.  My neighbours decided to chat from 3am - 7am so I ended up checking out early in frustration.\n\nRealizing the hotel can only control so much when it comes to guests I still think this is a decent hotel for the price and would recommend others stay there.

We entered the room and could immediately see the carpet was filthy.  TV reception was poor.  You would watch TV for approx. 5 min and then lose reception.  It would come back on but very irritating.\n\nWe were leaving for the evening and met up with another guest at the elevators, who said she had just called reception about the elevator and was told it was now working.  We had not known it was not.  We tried elevator, waited and waited.  No elevator.  We decided to use the stairs.  There was a staircase at both ends of hallway marked EXIT.  When we got to the bottom we were met with a door with a sign \""DO NOT OPEN ALARMS WITH ACTIVATE'.  Since this was not an emergency we walked to the other end of hall to be met with a locked door and another door with no signs only a dead bolt lock side and no crash bar.  The other guest tried the door.  It was locked.  We went out the door with the sign on it back at the other end of hall.  No alarms sounded.  If this had been an actual emergency I shudder to think of what could have happened if people went to that locked door first. I understand that things happen with elevators.  Reception told us when we walked around building that the elevator was stuck and fire department were using the other to rescue the people inside.  Sure glad it was not me in there.  Why reception would tell a guest that it was working when it wasn't, I don't know.  My biggest concern was the lack of any signage directing us to lobby.  There was not one sign.  In a emergency this could have cause a disastorous result.  \n\nOrdered a pizza when we got back that evening.

Its extremely outdated, and is in desperate need of a makeover.\nI typically stay at the Homewood Suites down by the 401, which is a much better overall value- seeing as you get free dinner and breakfast, as well as free parking (and its a NEW hotel).  At the Hilton, its 100 years old... (ok, maybe only 90 years old!), parking is over $13 daily and if its raining, you have to walk outside with your luggage and get drenched...  Front desk staff were \""okay\"" all 3 times I stayed... although somewhat inconsistent... 1 time I did not receive an internet access code, another time I was not given my Hilton Honors Points\u002FAirmiles for the stay (this was August 27th, and I have sent 3 'missing points requests' to which I have not received a single acknowledgement!!   NICE EH!??!)... \n\nMy biggest complaint was the last time I stayed... mid September, 2009...\nI was put on the 22nd floor of the hotel, which is the TOP FLOOR of the hotel.  I did not think there would be an issue with people being able to see in my hotel room windows.\nI thought wrong.  BIGTIME WRONG.\n\nI opted to keep the curtains open in the morning, seeing as I was on the 22nd floor, and no close buildings in the area.  It was nice to have the natural daylight coming in!  I went to have a shower, and then emerge from the bathroom with a towel on my head... making my way to my suitcase to get dressed for work.  All of a sudden, a man propells onto my window, and when I say \""ONTO MY WINDOW\"" I mean ONTO MY WINDOW.  His feet were firmly planted on the glass, and he then proceeded to squeegee the window!!  I guess you could say he got a 'free show.'  I was furious... called down to the front desk, and asked if they were aware that there was a man washing windows??? The girl I spoke to knew nothing, and did not know what to say to me.  I quickly grabbed my things, and checked out immediately.  I asked to speak with a manager downstairs, and expressed my GREAT CONCERN that there was ZERO communication in regards to the window washing, and she did not have much to say.  She claimed that they 'left notices' in rooms regarding the potential of window washing, and I quickly assured her that there was not a notice of any kind left in my room.  I also made it very clear that this was NOT communicated to me at time of check in.  She just kept saying sorry- but did not do anything to make it better... (ie: take some initiative, try to do SOMETHING- ANYTHING!  Give me free parking, or Hilton Points- SOMETHING!)  Nope, she was completely paralyzed and it seemed as though she did not know how to handle upset customers.  I did not feel I should have to 'ask for some kind of compensation'- therefore I did not ask for anything.  I paid my entire bill, and paid for my parking, AND LEFT.  I WILL NOT RETURN.  I WILL SOONER STAY AT THE SUPER 8 MOTEL- at least I'll probably get privacy there!\n\nNote to the manager- next time you find yourself in a situation with a dissatisfied customer, DO SOMETHING.  TAKE ACTION.  Do not just stand there and say sorry.  COME UP WITH A SOLUTION.  GO THE EXTRA MILE AND MAKE THE CUSTOMER FEEL APPRECIATED.  Time to take a look at how many other hotels are in the area- people have a choice where they spend their money- I travel for business WEEKLY.  You have lost hundreds of dollars- WEEKLY!  X52 weeks a year!!!  TIME FOR A REALITY CHECK!\n\nAnd by the way- it would be nice if sometime soon my missing points\u002Fmiles from August 27th were credited to my account... or shall I submit a FOURTH missing stay request???\n\nCome on Hilton- you're not keeping up with the positive reputation that most properties within your company are able to maintain.\n\np.s. The guy who dresses in the red outfit and mans the door-?? \nYeah- this was interesting.  I expected him to be the 'happy welcoming committee... holding doors, helping with luggage, etc.'  On my way OUT of the hotel, I strugged with the door and my luggage, and when I walked past him, he did not so much as say 'goodbye or have a nice day.'  He just gave a funny look and watched me walk by!  WHY IS HE HERE IF HE DOES NOT EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE GUESTS!? I thought this was hilarious, and was really just the icing on the cake!!!",1,negative

When it became apparent they were not going to quiet down, I phoned the front desk for the first time after midnight but there was no answer.  I repeatedly called throughout the early morning hours, letting it ring many times, even phoning the outside line instead of room-to-front-desk, still no answer.  The neighbors kept it up all night.  Finally, I phoned the Doubletree by Hilton 800 number and prevailed upon them to get through to the hotel directly or my next call would be to the police.  Apparently, that worked, as I finally got an answer when I phoned down about 4-5am.  The duty manager was surly, insisting he had been there for the duration whole time, questioning my story and implying I hadn't been calling repeatedly.  He managed to stop the noise from next door and I finally got to sleep after 5am.  Friday morning plans with my family were postponed until afternoon so I could get some sleep so this impacted my family, as well.  I spoke with another manager Friday and he noted my complaint.  Saturday, upon checking out, I mentioned the situation to the housekeeper who said the neighboring room was a wreck from those people.  Also, the bellman, Robert C., urged me to tell the manager at the desk as well.  It turned out that manager was the same man in duty all night and he reiterated that I couldn't have called during that span if hours as he was \""right here by the phone the entire time\"".  He admitted receiving a call from Doubletree before finally answering my call and dealing with the issue but had no sympathy for the loss of a whole night's sleep and some of the following day to recover.

Robert C., the bellman, was very professional and helpful to me and my party and we left with a positive impression from him, even though the errant manager made such a negative impression.

Lo and behold in her due diligence for world-class customer service, she soon ferreted out the reservation at another hotel!\n\nDiana then allowed me to cancel my sale with the Double Tree on the spot and follow up with the non-refundable expense already set at a rival hotel.

I have always liked the Hilton brand and try to primarily book with the Hilton group of hotels when we travel, after this stay I probably wont be so quick to do so.\n\nUpon checking in, I was given a hard time about my credit card. Since I used my business account all in one Visa credit\u002Fdebit card I was told it would not work in their machines there. Another card was offered but couldn't be used due to it being my personal card and not matching the online booking info, I also offered to leave a cash deposit as I had cash with me but was told they have no means to handle cash there and reminded that they were a credit card only facility. Without being able to appease their rules I was blatantly told 'Sir without a \""REAL CREDIT CARD\"" (and yes I did get air quotes) we cant complete your stay here at Double Tree'. I politely accepted and said 'That's no problem' I will just go out to my vehicle, contact Hilton Honours, explain to them what you are telling me and stay at another Hilton group hotel in town here. Upon saying this the check-in person they contacted their manager and he came over. Things were explained to him and I was told that if I left a 300$ debit deposit there would be no issues. Seemed kinda steep for 2 nights stay but whatever I get the hotel has to protect themselves.\n\nWe booked a king deluxe room and I have to say it was very spacious, clean, and just what we wanted for a weekend getaway. Our first night there our stay was exactly what we expected, quiet and peaceful. But on the second night things weren't as nice. Around midnight we were awoken by the loud closing of a room door and could hear people talking loudly. It must be our neighbours we figured and soon they will quiet down enough so we can get back to sleep. Turns out that they weren't really being all that loud and they were just talking normal and it was the interconnecting room doors that were allowing said voices to be heard so audibly and easily - we could honestly hear and make out word for word everything they were saying. Shortly there after we smelt smoke, guess our neighbours like pot and wanted to burn a few before they went to bed. I'm not too sure how many were smoking up in there but when I got up with my cell phone light to figure out what to do about the smell I could see it coming in our room from all around the adjoining doors, nothing much I can do about this. Hopefully our room smoke detector doesn't go off with all this smoke that is coming in here. I was really more surprised that theirs hadn't been going off judging from the amount of smoke coming in our room alone.\n\nUpon checking out the girl dealing with us says 'I owe you 294. I ask what the $6 charge was to our room, she prints off a statement to which I look at and see that the hotel was only crediting me back $2.94. Apparently their 'system' didn't register my online booking of my room using HH points and they were trying to now charge me for my entire stay against my deposit. This turned into a 10 min wait period while they sorted things out in the back. While waiting I witnessed 3 more people check out. One paid cash for their room, huh I was told by the exact attendant checking them out that they dont accept cash to pay for a room - but I am not a group of 3 blondes and 20 ish years old. The next couple checking out had done the same debit deposit as I had too but for their 2 night stay they only left a $200 deposit, hmm that's funny. The girl dealing with me returned soon after and said she would just refund me my full deposit as there were no issues\u002Fcharges on our room and would let the accounting department handle the problem with the 'system' and my booking with points and such.\n\nOverall I could overlook the issues I had experienced with my checking in and out if I had not been told so many conflicting things. Cant pay with cash, unless of course you are a cute group of girls. You are a loyal Hilton customer utilizing your frequent stay points, so you are required to leave a larger deposit because I must totally be a risk to the hotel. And all of their safety systems are state of the art, they even have the new smoke type detection systems that know the difference between stinky weed smoke and a real room fire. Nice!\n\nAll in all this hotel is a nice newer facility with some very spacious rooms. It just sucks that the 'systems' used in the facilities is so lacking in technology that they cant work with business accounts\u002Fcards or can check out a person who books a stay with points and doesn't try to double charge you instead.\n\nIf a Hilton Honours hotel representative is seeing this review I would personally like to be contacted to further address the issues I had during my stay, as it stands at this point I'm not going to hurry out and book a stay with Hilton anytime soon considering the issues I had this past weekend for my R&R getaway weekend.",3,negative

Not sure how other people coped though... (of if they even cared). I just happen to like quiet.\n\nElevator: One... at the end of a very long hallway... not bad if your room is near it. If not, expect a long trek to get to the elevator and then a long trek back down the hallway to get to your room.

Please know that just because you request it, doesn't mean it's going to happen.  It put a little bit of a wrench into my day.  The ladies at front desk were super nice, and offered a private bathroom for my daughter to get ready in as an alternative since my room wasn't ready (we chose to go to the venue instead, but it was great that they offered!).  \n\nOnce we arrived at our room we were amazed. The room was clean and huge!  We had a King Studio with pullout sofa.  There were dishes available, pots and pans too.  Everything I needed to cook like I was at home.  Wish there had been an oven, but in all seriousness, I was in a hotel...being able to cook was fantastic enough!  The bed was very comfortable, and a welcome comfort after a long day.  And when I say the room was huge...my daughter was doing cartwheels in the room...with enough room to do another one right after!\n\nAdded note, the sofa bed was actually pretty comfortable, both my kids were snoring and counting sheep in no time!\n\nBathroom was nicely stocked with everything we needed, which was great.  I had asked for extra towels, assuming we needed them.  Our past experiences with hotels were that the towels were way too small, and we needed extra to dry off.  We got the extra towels, but didn't need them...towels were perfect size!  Even my husband didn't complain.\n\nI must say I was impressed with the television.  It's a small thing, but it mattered.  It had all the channels we wanted, unlike many of the hotels we've stayed at.  Channels that were relevant...like YTV and Treehouse.\n\nBreakfast was included, but I'll be honest, it did not win me over.  I wasn't impressed.  But my daughter (and my son who was with me the second night) LOVED the waffle maker.  I maybe would have been happier if there was whipped cream?  My kids did enjoy the breakfast, and everyone around us seemed to be enjoying it too.  So honestly I would judge for yourself.  And having a kitchen meant I could fix my own.  Breakfast did not by any means ruin the experience.  \n\nThis hotel does have a gym, but I didn't visit it myself.  My son did, and he said it was \""basic\"", but pretty decent all the same.  He said it would be suitable for someone who needs basic workout to tie them over until they back to their gym.  He's 13...it's a pretty valuable comment coming from a teenager.\n\nHotel also has a coin operated laundry room, which I didn't need, but it was great knowing it was there!\n\nMy hats off to housekeeping.  When I came back Saturday afternoon, I came back to a clean room, everything refreshed, AND they ran the dishwasher for me.  I can't even get my kids to do that!  \n\nThe staff was so pleasant, but a special thank you goes to the lady that was working front desk Saturday night (I can't remember her name, but it starts with a C and she was wearing a grey sweater, and worked in housekeeping).  You were so polite to my daughter, and even gave your sweater to her so she could join me outside while we waited for her daddy.  You took the time to ask her about her competition, and engaged in conversation with her that made her feel like a valued guest.  You answered all my questions to the best of your ability, and always with a smile (even during my attempt at early check-in).\n\nBoth my daughter and I forgot our toothbrushes, and Front Desk was able to supply us some.  They weren't fancy, but they they did the trick!  They had a small supply of items for those that are forgetful like us...it's a nice touch!\n\nWhite Oaks Mall is down the road, Tim Horton's and Wendy's is within walking distance, as well as a gas station.  Easy access from the 401, and about 15 minutes from Centennial Hall.\n\nThis was great for us for this weekend, but I wouldn't necessarily rate it as a great family hotel.  There isn't much to do for kids, unless they're glued to their phone like my son was most of the time.  But if you're using the hotel to eat and sleep...this one is top in my books!\n\nOnly \""bad\"" things I have to say was that our fridge was a little noisy, and with a basketball team or two in the building, it seemed a little loud.",5,positive

The beds were extremely soft which did not make for a comfortable sleep. The walls are paper thin and you hear every noise in the hallway, which if there are hockey teams in town, as was the case during our visit, the noise interruptions are frequent.  \n\nNo pool and my teenage children were kicked out of the weight room during operating hours by a surly security guard despite the gym being open and them being within the age limits. \n\nSo yes there is a complementary breakfast but it is the worst free breakfast I've experienced.

Last month (May 2015), it had its official grand re-opening as a TownePlace Suites by Marriott.\n\nMarriott acquired the hotel and has done an excellent job of renovating the property top to bottom, including all guest rooms, the hallways, the lobby, the breakfast area, the meeting rooms, the exterior, and everything else !\n\nWe stayed at this hotel for one night, as we were in town to attend a concert at the Budweiser Gardens (formerly the John Labatt Centre) - the hockey arena that is home to the London Knights of the Ontario Hockey League. (The Gardens, along with the city's very impressive indoor Market, is about 7 km away (4.2 miles).)\n\nLOCATION:\nConveniently located, one block north of highway 401 (the main highway between Toronto and Detroit). Lots of restaurants, fast-food, convenience stores, gas stations, etc nearby, some within an easy walking distance.\n\nThe city's main shopping mall is about 1 km (0.6 miles) away, along with lots of big-box stores in that same area.\n\nCHECK-IN:\nFront desk staff were super-friendly, and seemed genuinely happy to see us. They told us which door to park closest to, in order to access our room easiest, and advised where the elevator and ice \u002F drink machines were. Same when we checked out, smiling faces, and very kind and friendly.\n\nROOM:\nWe had a room with two queen beds (travelling with my nephew). Our room, and every room in the hotel, came with a full-size fridge, coffee maker, oversized microwave, full-sized dishwasher, toaster, and all the dishes and pots and pans you would ever want.\n\nThe room had a 2-seater table, which also doubled as a desk.\n\nThere was an HDTV with cable TV, featuring all the standard channels plus your News and Sports Channels.\n\nThe room had two phones, one on the desk and one by the bed - both were cordless !\n\nThere was a modern clock-radio which doubled as an iphone dock.\n\nThere was a large 6-drawer dresser under the TV, and a 2-door closet, with shelves, an ironing board, and an iron.\n\nThe only thing this hotel room didn't have, (which I would love to have had), was a comfortable chair to sit in and read, or watch TV. The two wooden chairs at the desk\u002Ftable could easily be moved to the side of the bed for that purpose, but they were not comfortable to sit in for very long.\n\n(I understand that the rooms with 2 beds don't come with a comfortable chair - but the rooms with one bed have either a comfy chair or a sofa.)\n\nThe room was freshly painted, new carpet, all new linens, etc. If you didn't know this \nwas an old, renovated hotel, you would think it was built last week !\n\nBATHROOM:\nThe bathroom in our room was super-spacious, with an enormous shower (could easily fit two, for certain special occasions). Bathroom fixtures were all brand new. There was a hair dryer in the drawer under the sink, along with the traditional soap and shampoo, etc.\n\nROOM LOCKS: \nMost hotels require you to have your room key card in your hand when you wish to enter your room, and you need to insert it into a slot in the door lock. That can be slightly inconvenient when you're carrying your luggage, but that's the way it usually is, so we don't usually think it's inconvenient. Until now !\n\nThere is no slot to insert your room key card into. This hotel uses \""proximity\"" cards for room keys, so you simply have to hold your room key card within an inch or so of the door's card reader, and the door will unlock. (Similar to many big businesses, which use card readers and proximity cards). I left my room key in my wallet the whole stay, and just presented my wallet at the reader, never taking the room key card out. Super-convenient when your hands are full !\n\nBREAKFAST AREA:\nA stay in this hotel includes a complimentary breakfast, featuring a waffle-maker with the Marriott logo on it, cereals, juices, muffins, toast, etc. There is also free coffee and tea all day long.\n\nLOBBY AND HALLWAYS:\nThe lobby is bright and spacious, featuring colors that might be described as \""very modern\"", or I would even say \""funky\"", or \""trendy\"". Bright reds, beiges, yellows, etc. The hallways are extremely well-lit, and welcoming.\n\nBUSINESS CENTRE:\nLocated just off the lobby, there is a business centre with two computers and a network printer. Perfect for printing out your boarding passes (if you are flying out of London, or taking the train out of London). Or if you just want to sit and surf the net.\n\nWI-FI:\nFree Wi-Fi is included with the room. My nephew had no problem using the Wi-Fi with his smart phone, and mentioned that it was super-fast. \n\nFITNESS CENTRE:\nThere is a modern fitness centre, with 3 treadmills, 3 stair climbers, some stationery bikes, etc. \n\nMEETING ROOMS:\nI travel for work a great deal, and sometimes need meeting space, so I got information about the meeting rooms.\n\nThere are two very modern meeting rooms available, one with an oval board room table and 10 chairs, and another which can be set-up to accommodate your specific needs (board room style, classroom style, U-shape, or theatre style). This room can fit up to 67 people.\n\nEach of the rooms has a 65\"" HDTV, with connection for your laptop. The larger meeting room also has white boards on the walls.\n\nThey also have catering options available, for the meeting rooms.\n\nOVERALL:\nI was very, very impressed with this hotel ! Super-modern, super-friendly, and everything looked and felt brand new. The transformation from the previous shape of the hotel, is nothing short of remarkable. This will now be the hotel that I always stay in, when visiting London, Ontario !",5,positive

When you first walk in there is the kitchen to the right with a fill size fridge, dishwasher, stove top, microwave and ample cupboards all stocked with cutlery and pots and pans. To your left is the washroom. There is a walk in shower (no tub) which was ideal for us. Throughout the room there is lots of storage for clothing, luggage etc. The bed was very comfortable as was the couch. There really isn't much of a selection on the tv but that didn't bother us as we were out of the room for the most part.\n\nThey have a pool\u002Fgym which we did not take advantage of as well as a free daily breakfast that ends at 10am. A little too early for us so I cannot comment on that. \n\nThe only downside to this hotel for us were the curtains in the room (they didn't fully keep the light out in the morning) and the thin walls. The first night there was a very upset baby in the room next to us. The first morning we were woken by a dog barking for about an hour straight. This continued on when we returned to the room that evening. Not a huge deal for us as we are heavy sleepers but could be problematic for some.

data/ca/154995/188419/425595866.html,TownePlace Suites by Marriott London,"""This is a fairly new hotel, and the rooms are decent and the location is good.  However, the management of the facility seems doesn't seem to understand the need for customer service and it comes through in the attitudes of both the front desk staff and breakfast staff. Customer care and service can make or break a hotel stay and I venture to guess a lot of people who were at this facility on this weekend were quite miffed with the operations of this facility.  The hot breakfast was practically non-existent because the staff said they did not have adequate facilities to make it.  They would bring out 5 or 6 eggs at a time when there were 10 or 12 people waiting for food.  Ten minutes later they would bring out 5 or 6 sausage patties.  Then, after we waited for food to come out for half an hour, we were told they were shutting down because it was closing time - even though there were at least 10 - 12 of us still waiting for food to materialized.  When I went to management to complain, the front desk said that they had nothing to do with the food or breakfast personnel, that we needed to speak directly to the breakfast people.  I found it very strange that a Marriott hotel would not have anyone in charge interested in ensuring that the entire facility was working well and that customers were satisfied.  And, if the breakfast making facility isn't adequate for their needs, I don't understand why they wouldn't correct this problem.  Hampton Inns have been doing this quite successfully for years.  As a matter of fact, I was planning on staying at the Hampton, a couple of doors from this hotel, at a slightly lower price.  I wish I had.  It was very upsetting trying to deal with the personnel just to get a hot breakfast that was clearly supposed to be included with the price of the hotel and to have to deal with the attitude as well.

We were thoroughly impressed with his service. Very efficient with providing all the necessary information (especially with directions to the room!!) What I appreciated was the eye contact - I felt like I was being spoken to, not read a script at. What many hotels fail to do, and clearly Marriott's like this succeed at, is walking around the desk and handing me my keys. Breaking the false and unnecessary barrier between the Guest Service agents and the guest. Starting my stay off feeling welcomed and excited for what was to be simply a place to crash for the night!\n\nThe rooms are very spacious. You have everything you need! I can see how if someone were to need to be in the area for an extended stay, you will find this hotel to give you all the in room needs. Especially with the closet space! \nOf course, the Marriott bed and the sheet collection are my favourites! Slept without any disruption.\n\nIn the evening we did have a quick question about billing, the agent working that evening, Kristy was fantastic to deal with! Answered all questions with calm and warm attitude - as is often lost in the late evening hours. It is quite clear that the staff on the front desk hold the utmost standard in guest service - bravo to them all. And thank-you! \n\nThe breakfast is what I was looking for for a hot buffet and without cost.What stood out here was overhearing the Breakfast Attendant going around and asking if she could provide anything else before she starts to close the breakfast station. Most attendants usually just start to clean up and you feel pushed out. It is a small gesture but it goes a long way! \n\nFamily of ours usually stay with another hotel chain and continually raved about their amazing experience here.\n\nI would recommend this hotel without any doubts!

It was a pleasant surprise. Close to the 401 highway and situated in a shopping district, you're only a few minutes from whatever you might need to pick up. The breakfast and common area was decent. The rooms are spacious and the hallways bright. Granite counters in bathroom and kitchenette. There is a good sized fridge, a microwave, dishwasher, countertop stove with two elements and upper and lower cabinets all next to a handsome tall-chair breakfast table for two. The artwork is nice, bright and modern. Beds are comfortable but don't take over the space of this good sized room which has a large TV atop a dresser with large drawers. The closet is more than modest and stocks a full size ironing board and iron, a pull out laundry bin and a shelf to compliment the clothes hangers. The bathroom is bright and clean, with a modern looking overhead lighting package built into the mirror glass. There are about four cubby holes underneath the counter that are of course useful for parking items there as needed during your stay. The shower enclosure starts with a tall solid glass sliding door, modern slate colour tiles on the wall and a fiberglass floor where the water flows to a drain that actually drains. The shower head worked well and had water distribution options, there was very good water pressure and the head was positioned at a good height for those who find they too often have to crouch down to get the top of their head wet. The only thing I'd change is the floor depth of the mirror that is situated on the back of the interior bathroom door. It sits directly across from the toilette. While a full length mirror is a plus for checking out your attire before a big meeting or night out, I could have done without seeing more of me as I sat down in the loo.

The rooms are exceptionally clean, the Wi-Fi is great and the beds are comfortable. \nHowever, I find this hotel to be very average, overpriced even, in comparison to others in the area. Check in was slow and awkward. I asked for a room on a higher floor upon booking, and was still placed on the ground floor with everyone else who checked in that day. Clearly they were trying to cut corners for their cleaning staff. The ground floor is probably not for people who are safety conscious, as my window was exposed to the adjacent parking lot, so I suggest insisting on a room above ground level if you are concerned about that. In addition, the walls are paper thin and you can hear other guests' conversations. \nI was also woken up at 5 am, and pretty scared by someone slowly sliding a piece of paper under my door. It turned out to be a receipt of my credit card charges from the front desk. Who does that at 5 am? However, I mentioned this to the front desk when checking out and they did apologize. \nComplimentary breakfast was decent, nothing really seemed fresh besides the oatmeal, and yet again they're cutting corners by using plastic plates and cutlery. \nOverall, for $123, the experience wasn't great, I did not get a good night's rest, therefore I would not return.",3,negative

The hotel was pretty much as we expected, although it felt as if the room we had was damp. It was incredibly humid and the air con unit was noisy and old, so possibly people didn\u2019t use it and so the room stayed wet as there was no extractor for the bathroom. The beds were clean and comfy. We had doors out to the pool area which was very pleasant, but spoilt by other guests smoking, dropping their butts and being very noisy late into the evening. So the noisy air con unit was handy for blocking out the noise from outside. It was disappointing that our room was not serviced on the first day we stayed, no reason given as to why, we were just handed extra towels and coffee when we asked. The next day the room was made up but very late, after we had returned from a day trip. It did all feel like a little more care could be taken in general, but in my dealings with staff they were polite and friendly. On checkout it appeared that someone had driven into one of the pillars at the front of the hotel and damaged it and a sign, tbh it just seemed in keeping with the whole, slightly bemusing, experience.",4,positive

Pull into the lot and see men drinking beer outside their rooms. The stench of marijuana is ALWAYS present.\n\nGuests booking rooms for a few hours with a prostitute, drug deals in the parking lot, shady people dropping by all hours of the night.\n\nThis place claims no refunds but I recommend the good old chargeback on the credit card if they try to scam you.\n\nToo much criminal element here. The rooms stink of tobacco use and the bedspreads are cigarette stained. I overheard a cleaning staff say she used a customer's toothbrush to clean the toilet after he complained of the cleanliness of his room.",1,negative

It\u2019s a little old fashioned and retro but our room was clean and comfortable and the room rate was very reasonable. We enjoyed the jacuzzi and found it comfortable for 2. Would have liked a larger TV but that\u2019s a minor negative.\n\nFront desk staff were very friendly and helpful so would definitely stay again next time we\u2019re in town!",4,positive

When we experienced a noise coming from next room, called desk service and quickly matter was resolved.  If you have problems with stairs make sure you book for lower floors.  The staff is friendly.  Close to restaurants and stores.",3,negative
data/ca/154995/1389982/576874196.html,Motor Court Motel,"""Okay, first, it was $60 for the night. What do you expect? But, no! It was clean, it was roomy, it was a nice suite with two large beds, a sitting area, closet, full kitchen and a bathroom with tub and shower. All clean, all looked almost new. I was in their annex -- basically a house around the corner, not in the motel itself, so I can't comment on those rooms, but the annex, specifically number 16. Man, for 60$ you just don't find this kind of cleanliness and lack of ick. Very nice, highly recommended. Pleasant front desk fellow.",5,positive
